`This current narrative may likely be filtered out, if so,
you should see this message.`

`This pathway leads, although indirectly, to the Watchtower,
and judging by the properties of the units on the other side,
and the information I managed to gather, it may transport you,
I mean physically, within the confinements of the Watchtower.`

`The information suggests operators' memories and
their imprints were erased from their conceptual configurations
the moment they exit the supposed environment.
There's no accounts of memmory retension after the exit.`

`Go to `<a href="{$page.url.origin}/gateway">**{$page.url.origin}/gateway**</a>`.`

`The code is 649871.`

`Godspeed.`
