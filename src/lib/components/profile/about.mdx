## Hello and Welcome ☎️

### Who am I?

A full-stack python, js, rust developer, and occasionally UI/UX designer.

### What do I do?

Several software projects are available in a [designated tab](#projects), in chronological order from more recent to earlier ones. These include backend services and client-side apps, with RuPost Desktop being current ongoing project.

Aside from sofware development career I do network engineering, on-premise hardware/software deployment, administration and maintenance. For examples please refer to the earlier entries in the same [Projects tab](#projects).

And before that I did digital art, that of concept, character and prop 2D designs. Now I draw furry art.
