# Retroactive Refractory Feedback Loop

RRFL is an event of <Link path="/mawanet/standard_reality">standard reality</Link> reshaping due to changed perception of such reality by a remote oberver in accordance with its observer's undertanding of a <Link path="/mawanet/narrative">narrative</Link> which takes place in specific area of space-time.

Narrative's effects of <Link path="/mawanet/standard_reality">standard reality</Link> <Link path="/mawanet/superimposition_event">superimposed</Link> by, as mentioned in conceptual framework of <Link path="/mawanet/narraphysics">narraphysics</Link>, by <Link path="/mawanet/observer">observer</Link>s' perceptions' which shape the nature of events those took place during a creation of a <Link path="/mawanet/narrative">narrative</Link>, mutate them retroactively in attempt to "patch up" the temporal and casual inconsistencies.

1. An Observer is placed in a <Link path="/mawanet/standard_reality">standard reality</Link> connected with <Link path="/mawanet/narraphysic_realm">narraphysic realm</Link>.

2. <Link path="/mawanet/observer">observer</Link> discovers for himself a favorable narrative persistent through a timeline of event. Note that the timeline of event may not be complete, this fact does not matter since observer forms his own interpretation of a <Link path="/mawanet/narrative">narrative</Link> (virtual interpretation).

3. Interpretaion reaches the physical placement of a narrative. Considering the similarity with the local VIs and amount of observers with similar VIs, this feedback may or may not cause <Link path="/mawanet/superimposition_event">superimposition event</Link> in any derivation.

- Superimposition event occures:

    1. A <Link path="/mawanet/superimposition_event">superimposition event</Link> occures which reshapes reality by high-level propagation of a concept of a virtual interpretation of a <Link path="/mawanet/narrative">narrative</Link> from an observer while he interprets it, by exchange of <Link path="/mawanet/perception_particle">perception particle</Link>s.

    2. Portions of reality connected with <Link path="/mawanet/narraphysic_realm">narraphysic realm</Link> that previously were tethered to a concrete configuratiion of <Link path="/mawanet/standard_reality">standard reality</Link> in a Landscape, change its configuration.

- Superimposition event do not occure:

    1. Accumultes to the total probability of <Link path="/mawanet/superimposition_event">superimposition event</Link> from his narrative occuring when it reaches higher total probability relative to other narratives.

## Retroactivity

In an event of <Link path="/mawanet/superimposition_event">superimposition</Link> it affects actors of a <Link path="/mawanet/narrative">narrative</Link> shich is superimposed, actors may be retroactively changed to a different configuration of their persons' including concptual identities, which contain an expected timeline to conform to a superimposed virtual interpretation of a narrative.
