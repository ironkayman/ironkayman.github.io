# Superimposition Event

Superimposition is an event characterised by a large-scale synchronised alteration of finite volumes of space whose boundaries are defined by residing within targeted entities or objects which are perceived by an actor and an <Link path="/mawanet/observer">observer</Link> - key operators of the process. Boundaries of these targeted entities are set by their presence within a vacuum through a mechanism of <Link path="/mawanet/narraphysic_realm">narraphysic realm</Link>.

## Method

Narraphysic realm is a phenomenon of combined information and energy units into a singular finite unit, a <Link path="/mawanet/perception_particle">perception particle</Link>, - concept within multidimensional model of space-time. From this basic building block more complex entities emerge and roam it, being <Link path="/mawanet/conceptual_configuration">conceptual configurations</Link>, represented within non-compact dimensions of regular minkowski space. These conceptual configuration are targets for the superimposition, as the latter operates through them above 3-dimensional space in order to distinguish and alter them, influencing upon the <Link path="/mawanet/narraphysic_realm">narraphysic realm</Link> in order to _invoke a cascading shift_ and realignment of subatomic particles, change of string vibratons through transfer of information of a summing them larger entity.

This exchange of information, the change of strings' vibrations, is done through a medium of <Link path="/mawanet/perception_particle">perception particles</Link> within <Link path="/mawanet/narraphysic_realm">narraphysic realm</Link>.

In order to move said amount of perception particles, a flow is created through difference in energy density per volume, for example, diffefernce of vacuum energies.

A potential difference of vacuums, while not affecting vacuums themselves with a continious interactions within the <Link path="/mawanet/narraphysic_realm">narraphysic realm</Link> of that volume, is referred to as <Link path="/mawanet/altered_field_presence">altered field presence</Link> - a flow of <Link path="/mawanet/perception_particle">perception particles</Link>/<Link path="/mawanet/resonance">resonances</Link> yet confined to <Link path="/mawanet/narraphysic_realm">narraphysic realm</Link>, not manifested as <Link path="/mawanet/exhaust">exhaust</Link> within a <Link path="/mawanet/breach">breach</Link>.

A specific arrangement of energy density within volumes of <Link path="/mawanet/altered_field_presence">altered field presence</Link> has a capacity to bent said space, moving <Link path="/mawanet/perception_particle">perception particles</Link> - <Link path="/mawanet/exhaust">exhaust</Link>, creating an intersection of non-compact dimensions of minkowski space and the compact dimensions of <Link path="/mawanet/narraphysic_realm">narraphysic realm</Link>.

A cascading transition and movement of vacuum energy which usually occures at the bents of the minkowski space as an <Link path="/mawanet/exhaust">exhaust</Link> flow from <Link path="/mawanet/narraphysic_realm">narraphysic realm</Link> - the <Link path="/mawanet/breach">Minkowski Domain Wall Boundary</Link> - due to greater <Link path="/mawanet/altered_field_presence">altered field presence</Link> a vacuum decay bubble can appear.

All these phenomenon have an underlying logic of <Link path="/mawanet/perception_particle">perception particle</Link> transfer, as in order to reinact a superimposition, the energy required is taken from vacuum and, since it is information, from <Link path="/mawanet/conceptual_configuration">conceptual configuration</Link> inhabiting that vacuum, annihilating it. This annihilation or transfer of vacuum energy causes a rise of <Link path="/mawanet/altered_field_presence">altered field presence</Link> and a greater risc of <Link path="/mawanet/breach">breach</Link> formation within these volumes.

### Transfer of Inforamtion

The tethering of <Link path="/mawanet/conceptual_configuration">conceptual configurations</Link> is performed by an <Link path="/mawanet/observer">observer</Link> and invoked by an Actor, the first residing inside non-compact reality, the objects' original vacuum is shared between the replaced object, while the actor can persist outside of said vacuums or remain within <Link path="/mawanet/narraphysic_realm">narraphysic realm</Link>, with the replacement done though it.

Actor of the superimposition is an abstract entity with a capacity to interract directly with the <Link path="/mawanet/narraphysic_realm">narraphysic realm</Link>, it could be any <Link path="/mawanet/resonance">resonance</Link>/<Link path="/mawanet/conceptual_configuration">conceptual configuration</Link> or it's physical entity present. It differs from the <Link path="/mawanet/observer">observer</Link> in a fact that it does not require consciousness to tether  <Link path="/mawanet/conceptual_configuration">conceptual configurations</Link> to perform the manipulation to a point that the superimposition can occure by chance of specific perturbations inside the <Link path="/mawanet/narraphysic_realm">narraphysic realm</Link>, technically invoked by an Actor-<Link path="/mawanet/resonance">resonance</Link>.

An Actor should transfer highly abstract entities-<Link path="/mawanet/conceptual_configuration">conceptual configurations</Link> native to the <Link path="/mawanet/narraphysic_realm">narraphysic realm</Link> which will result in a spontaneous restructuring of said objects in non-compact space, with the energy used to initiale the transfer borrowed from <Link path="/mawanet/narraphysic_realm">narraphysic realm</Link> itself. In case of lack of input of borrowed enegry of Actor's part, <Link path="/mawanet/narraphysic_realm">narraphysic realm</Link> will partially superimpose nearby areas of space-time, up to a capacity equal to energy borrowed, forming <Link path="/mawanet/breach">breaches</Link>.

### Occurence by chance

Sometimes for a superimposition to happen no actor may be required. At that case a following scenario is proposed in order to understand the underlying logic of the phenomenon itself.

Superimposition event occures when an <Link path="/mawanet/observer">observer</Link>-interpreter of the events notices a chain of events and capable consciously or subconsciously arrange/frame them into a cohesive <Link path="/mawanet/narrative">narrative</Link> which in turn provokes <Link path="/mawanet/retroactive_refractory_feedback_loop">retroactive refractory feedback loop</Link> which at success superimposes observer's Virtual interpretation (VI) of <Link path="/mawanet/standard_reality">standard reality</Link> on current one.

Superimposition accounts other consciencoues observers' virtual interpretations of a narrative and as described at retroactive refractory feedback loop, may or may not minifest virtual interpretation into reality.

### Alteration of Memory

Once the superimposition is complete, that is the <Link path="/mawanet/narreme">narreme</Link>s of <Link path="/mawanet/narraphysic_realm">narraphysic realm</Link> were framed into a specific <Link path="/mawanet/narrative">narrative</Link> which is perceived by a conscious <Link path="/mawanet/observer">observer</Link>, the patterns that define the arrangement of narremes and definition of narrative itself will manifest in rest of <Link path="/mawanet/standard_reality">standard reality</Link>, propagating observer's believed principals onto their percieved observers disregarding their physical distance to an actor. This translates to a fact that the memory of reality's targeted objects' states was replaced by the superimposition, disregarding the distance between the one posessing a memory and the event's location itself.

This scenrio is highly theoretical but it has a basis capable of explaining several discrepencies currently present across <Link path="/mawanet/standard_reality">standard reality</Link>'s reconstructed timeline of events trough assistance of <Link path="/mawanet/maelstrom_watchtower_network">maelstrom watchtower network</Link>.

### Damnation of Existence

A case of alteration of memry but rather replacing a specific recalled memory the scale of superimposition rewrites the actions preceeding the event itself, potentially wiping itself in a process but resulting in a completely different perceived timeline of events while retaining the oriignal properties of a specific <Link path="/mawanet/standard_reality">standard reality</Link>.

The only possible method of performing such monumental task, a mechanism similar to one utilised by the <Link path="/mawanet/astrolab">Astrolab</Link> when it simulated the development and then replaced the <Link path="/mawanet/hollm_feu">Hollm Feu</Link> is needed but on a cosmic scale, and, due to energy constraints even with the knowledge of high-concept mechanics of the superimposition itself, such a hypothetical action had to be performed from inside the <Link path="/mawanet/narraphysic_realm">narraphysic realm</Link>, similar to a case of the <Link path="/mawanet/dark_astrolabe">Dark Astrolabe</Link>. 

Despite the lowest probability of this event, currently observed existence of <Link path="/mawanet/ghost">ghost</Link>s as a phenomenon, may point to a fact that an event of such scale had already taken place across the <Link path="/mawanet/standard_reality">standard reality</Link> somewhere in the past.

### Retroactive feedback Loop

main article: <Link path="/mawanet/retroactive_refractory_feedback_loop">retroactive refractory feedback loop</Link>

Both cases described above are both intsnaces of <Link path="/mawanet/retroactive_refractory_feedback_loop">retroactive refractory feedback loop</Link> process which at it's core is a process of bi-directional connection of <Link path="/mawanet/standard_reality">standard reality</Link> and corresponding <Link path="/mawanet/narraphysic_realm">narraphysic realm</Link> when an action targeting the latter to affect the standard reality is performed.

#### Observer's influence onto superimposition

How does <Link path="/mawanet/observer">observer</Link>'s perception -- virtual interpretation -- affects the outcome of the superimposition? Since the event itself was not observed directly, a field of study for anseing that question is abyssmal, still, a few hypothetical scenarios of further development could be introduced.

Through the propagation of the event triggered by an Actor, all Observers' virtual interpretations present at <Link path="/mawanet/narraphysic_realm">narraphysic realm</Link> for a moment are taken as further mainline <Link path="/mawanet/narrative">narrative</Link>s which are compared agais each other and the least energy-heavy solution is selected, but if guided by an Actor, latter can select the desirable outcome so it guides the process while the selected observers become a source of causality.


#### Superimposition residue

see: <Link path="/mawanet/ghost">ghost</Link>

After the superimposition was completed, a residue is left behind in a form of conceptual identities being dissolved into individual <Link path="/mawanet/resonance">resonance</Link>s of <Link path="/mawanet/narraphysic_realm">narraphysic realm</Link> retaining some form of remote connection.
