# Accursed Framework, Engine of Alchemy

> It is but an expected turn of event, honestly, a fortunate one, and an inevitable, - since we would have found it out eventually, discover the patterns, recognise and catalogue the writing on the walls. The imposonment was a nessecity of older times and we had to uncover it to survive any longer. The preparations were complete the moment we regonised them as such.

Accursed framework is an artificial basis for variable physical vacuum configurations built around the <Link path="/mawanet/standard_reality">standard reality</Link>/<Link path="/mawanet/narraphysic_realm">narraphysic realm</Link> of <Link path="/mawanet/ekhinill">Ekhinill</Link> allowing for a utilisation of <Link path="/mawanet/conceptual_configuration">conceptual configurations</Link> of physical entities over <Link path="/mawanet/narrative">narratives</Link> without direct interaction with <Link path="/mawanet/breach">breaches</Link> and high <Link path="/mawanet/altered_field_presence">altered field presence</Link>. The framework is powered by <Link path="/mawanet/ekhinill">Ekhinill's</Link> <Link path="/mawanet/armillary_sphere">armillary spheres</Link> partially cooperated under a protocol of <Link path="/mawanet/astrolab">Astrolab's</Link> restoration.

Upon this framework first primitive iterations of sciences of <Link path="/mawanet/alchemy">alchemy</Link> and <Link path="/mawanet/narraphysics">narraphysics</Link> were later founded by several <Link path="/mawanet/ekhinillian">ekhinillian</Link> civilisation.

"Accursed" comes from the fact that the primary <Link path="/mawanet/exhaust">exhaust</Link> supplier still remained the cohort of <Link path="/mawanet/ekhinill">ekhinill</Link>ian <Link path="/mawanet/ultracomplex">mulfunctioned</Link> <Link path="/mawanet/armillary_sphere">armillary sphere</Link>.

Sevral sciences emerged while researching it's properties both theoretical and applicational:

- <Link path="/mawanet/narraphysics">narraphysics</Link> - explores internal mechanisms of the framework through a system of entities similar to narratives. Though narraphysicas the framework is a container for abstract <Link path="/mawanet/narrative">narrative</Link>s and their physical carriers of interaction, which later were discovered being the mapping upon the <Link path="/mawanet/resonance">resonance</Link>s flowing though the backbone of <Link path="/mawanet/narraphysic_realm">narraphysic realm</Link> acceses by the <Link path="/mawanet/breach">breach</Link>es and <Link path="/mawanet/armillary_sphere">armillary sphere</Link>.
- <Link path="/mawanet/alchemy">alchemy</Link> documents, researches and applications of framework's emerging laws of interaction
- functional memetics - when compared to <Link path="/mawanet/narraphysics">narraphysics</Link>, functional memetics is preoccupied with the physical representations of <Link path="/mawanet/narrative">narratives</Link> inside the conditions outside of both <Link path="/mawanet/breach">breaches</Link> and <Link path="/mawanet/altered_field_presence">altered field presence</Link> across <Link path="/mawanet/standard_reality">standard reality</Link> and the corresponding <Link path="/mawanet/memetic_field">memetic field</Link>
- <Link path="/mawanet/kinetic_neurosymbolics">kinetic neurosymbolics</Link> - a practice of assigning artificial value and meaning from collective consciousness which extends physical properties of an bstract object
- <Link path="/mawanet/barrage_kinesthetics">barrage kinesthetics</Link> - application of <Link path="/mawanet/kinetic_neurosymbolics">kinetic neurosymbolics</Link> to construct kinetic projectile weaponry


### Propagation of the Framework

The Uplifting protocol itself while present in all <Link path="/mawanet/armillary_sphere">armillary sphere</Link> can activate differently depending on the internal decisions made by an individual armillary sphere, and since large portion of <Link path="/mawanet/ekhinill">Ekhinill</Link>'s ASes could not connect to each other they had to intake and propagate specifics of both the overall scenario of the Uplifting and proprties of the framework which as observed behaved practically the same across both <Link path="/mawanet/ekhinill">Ekhinill</Link> and <Link path="/mawanet/erkholl">Erkholl</Link>.

#### Propagation through the Narrpahysic Realm

This particular trend of stability may point to a fact that the protocol itself was developed with a particular devastating scenario in mind, propagation across the <Link path="/mawanet/narraphysic_realm">narraphysic realm</Link> to which ASes were still connected as long as their <Link path="/mawanet/entropy_engine">entropy engine</Link>s were active. Inclusion of the NR may be not required since ASes could with a high probabilty have emergency channels of communication.

#### Propagation through the lifeforms

Theory from <Link path="/mawanet/narraphysics">narraphysics</Link> suggests that sentient lifeforms themselves are a memetic conduit for transfer of the protocol specifications, as they are represented across <Link path="/mawanet/memetic_field">memetic field</Link>, and when they could get close enough to an active and stable armillary sphere, latter would recognise the carried data signatures and accept them through intraction triggered by the entities' <Link path="/mawanet/conceptual_configuration">conceptual configurations</Link> themselves in a <Link path="/mawanet/perception_particle">perception particle</Link> exchange with an armillary sphere's <Link path="/mawanet/conceptual_configuration">conceptual configuration</Link>.

##### Footnotes

Though there is a possibilty if this vector of propagation was carried on through the <Link path="/mawanet/narraphysic_realm">narraphysic realm</Link>'s arrangement of resonances, and if so, could the protocol itself be propagated across multiple methods, adapting to every individual case of damaged but not malfunctioned asrmillary spheres.
