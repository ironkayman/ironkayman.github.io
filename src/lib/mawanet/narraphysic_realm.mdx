# Narraphysic Realm

> Beyond the Gates which led to it, it is the ideal but not less absurd reflection of an absurd reality, a narraphysic one, of infinite plane of interconnected ideal shapes which could not be perceived from causual standpoint of an Observer and yet, in it's totality it has as much depth as the human condition itself from and upon which a narrative is formed.

Narraphysic realm is a set of additional high variable possibly potential physical properties added upon the <Link path="/mawanet/standard_reality">standard reality</Link> without explicit contradiction to the Standard Model or it's elemental particles.

Nrraphysic realm presence is detectable within areas of higher <Link path="/mawanet/altered_field_presence">altered field presence</Link>. There are currently at least 2 sources of it's contantly detectable activity:

1. <Link path="/mawanet/erkholl">Erkholl</Link>, due to activation of <Link path="/mawanet/armillary_sphere">armillary spheres</Link> and <Link path="/mawanet/doomsphere">Doomsphere</Link>
2. <Link path="/mawanet/ultracomplex">ultracomplex</Link> located within a system of <Link path="/mawanet/hollm_feu">Hollm Feu</Link>
3. <Link path="/mawanet/azet_tehollm">Azet Tehollm</Link>, possibly, as a primary site of discovery <Link path="/mawanet/warp_fluid">warp fluid</Link>

As of <Link path="/mawanet/erkholl">Erkholl</Link>, Narraphysic Realm is a designation to an artificial abstraction, maintained by <Link path="/mawanet/armillary_sphere">armillary spheres</Link> of a concept described below through which ASes themselves operate.


##### Interpretation 1

see: <Link path="/mawanet/accursed_framework">accursed framework</Link>

A more widespread interpretation of NR is a set of abstractions and restrictions placed upon the original NR - that being the <Link path="/mawanet/accursed_framework">Accursed Framework</Link>, maintained by an array of <Link path="/mawanet/ekhinill">Ekhinill's</Link>/<Link path="/mawanet/erkholl">Erkholl's</Link> <Link path="/mawanet/armillary_sphere">armillary spheres</Link> through restricted modification of spaces present in <Link path="/mawanet/standard_reality">standard reality</Link> while preserving the biderictional access between the narraphysic realm and the interactions occuring through it.


##### Interpretation 2

> This state of conceptual existence which persists seemingly independently, or rather, on top, of a concrete physics emerging from a concrete vacuum is the narraphysic realm.

see: <Link path="/mawanet/engine_of_narraphysic_gliding">engine of narraphysic gliding</Link>, <Link path="/mawanet/narraphysics">narraphysics</Link>, <Link path="/mawanet/acropolis">acropolis</Link>

Narraphysic realm at it's most abstract form is a phenomenon caused, presumably, by the <Link path="/mawanet/engine_of_narraphysic_gliding">engine of narraphysic gliding</Link> as a native environment for the concept of <Link path="/mawanet/acropolis">Acropolis</Link> to be manifested within the vacuum's civilisations, resulting in a reality posessing a conceptual layer of existance which is formed with the moment a vacuum is manifested into existence.

In case of a current <Link path="/mawanet/standard_reality">standard reality</Link> Narraphysic Realm is manifested as an ecosystem of ideas/<Link path="/mawanet/narrative">narratives</Link>, most of which are considered representations of concepts and ideas for a reality. This approach is seemingly places authority of sentience over existence itself, it is more plausible due to voluntary nature of <Link path="/mawanet/malevelent_presence">malevelent presence</Link>/<Link path="/mawanet/acropolis">Acropolis</Link> concept being integrated within a vacuum.

### Resolution of negative energy of the Vacuum

An existence of potential <Link path="/mawanet/resonance">energy paradox</Link> suggests existence of a deeper layer of the narraphysic realm or currently unknown mechanism the latter suggested herrein as a possible resolution to a paradox.

The formation of <Link path="/mawanet/breach">breaches</Link> as a mending mechanism after energy borrowed by manipulations involving <Link path="/mawanet/narraphysic_realm">narraphysic realm</Link> reveal that a pool of all potential energy shared across current vacuum should be utilised, the energy pulled from it is sufficient as long as total balance of vacuum energy allows for space-time to expanse, granted it's either negative or lack of curveture.

Without a paradox of negative energy being created <Link path="/mawanet/narraphysics">narraphysic</Link> operations pull energy from vacuum creating a paradox of negative energy. This mechanism can plausibly manifest as follows:

1. Once a <Link path="/mawanet/superimposition_event">superimposition event</Link> is performed, required energy is first absorbed from the Actor
2. If Actor's input energy is depleeted surounding space of performed superimposition vacuum is pulled at microscopic scale, forming temorary topological defects
3. Further drainage of vacuum causes an area of space-time to dissolve and be replaced instead of a topological defect a narraphysic realm taking entry through a <Link path="/mawanet/breach">breach</Link>
4. Over a <Link path="/mawanet/breach">breach</Link> a connection between narraphysic realm and a potential of the vacuum energy is established -- it is utilises to pull required energy in a form of a flow of <Link path="/mawanet/resonance">resonances</Link>. Some resonances, like <Link path="/mawanet/dark_astrolabe">Dark Astrolabe</Link>, or possibly <Link path="/mawanet/malevelent_presence">Malevelent Presence</Link> may be carried over a breach-realm boundry to manifest within a <Link path="/mawanet/breach">breach</Link> or outside it, a prime example being the <Link path="/mawanet/ultracomplex">Ultracomplex</Link>. While this process at it extremes may increase <Link path="/mawanet/breach">breach</Link> external volume, a possibility for a vacuum decay at it's boundries is also increasing, with a possible example being <Link path="/mawanet/breached_wasteland">breached wasteland</Link>
