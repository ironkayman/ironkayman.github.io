# Gap Ammunition

Gap ammunition is a category of projectile materials made with inclusion of <Link path="/mawanet/hordholl">hordholl</Link>.

Baseline premise of that ammuntion type is characterised by presence of unstable composites of <Link path="/mawanet/hordholl">hordholl</Link> within:

1. the primer, which is responsible for rapid decay of the included <Link path="/mawanet/hordholl">hordholl</Link> composite and initial openning of the <Link path="/mawanet/breach">breach</Link> within the barrel
2. patterns of hordholl microstructures within the propellant reacts with the initial <Link path="/mawanet/breach">breach</Link> and direct it for a propelled projectile to enter once it is out of the barrel
3. the slug most of the time is not manufactured with application of hordholl, but rather it depends on a target.

If the target resides within pre-Horizon Perimeter area, the projectile is made of non-hordholl polymers, as it is preserved over the accumulating narraphysic effects of the engineered <Link path="/mawanet/breach">breach</Link>.

If the target is present within precipice realm, offensive projectile concept should be preserved outside of it's physical structure, so it is then manufactured from hordholl crystalls, as any matter is affected by an engineered <Link path="/mawanet/breach">breach</Link>, despite the propellant allowing for a practically seamless transition for the projectile, it is still affected over changing <Link path="/mawanet/local_reality">local reality</Link> environments.

And finally, if the target is present within <Link path="/mawanet/narraphysic_realm">narraphysic realm</Link> itself, it could only be reached by a rival concept, which the slug marks rather than being an object which collides with the entity.

#### Health risks

Due to presence of unstable hordholl withing the cartridges and it's dacy during <Link path="/mawanet/breach">breach</Link> creation, it causes radioactive contamination when fired. Gap ammunition is prohibited within district cities as well as the weaponry that utilises this ammo whould be disposed over a period of time as apart from radioactive contamination, primer's capacity to create <Link path="/mawanet/breach">breaches</Link> degrades both the firing chamber and the barrel of a weapon.

Although users utilise regulary <Link path="/mawanet/decontamination_chamber">decontamination chambers</Link>, some weapon models utilising gap rounds could be maintained through this procss far longer or specifically as part of their maintanance cycle.
