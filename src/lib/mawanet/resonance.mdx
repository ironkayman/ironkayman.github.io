# Resonance

Resonance is an emerging sentient phenomenon of intersecting and bound together multiple cosmic strings (or presumably other objects) present within <Link path="/mawanet/narraphysic_realm">narraphysic realm</Link>. Resonances usually exists strictly within <Link path="/mawanet/narraphysic_realm">narraphysic realm</Link> without exhibiting any influence onto <Link path="/mawanet/standard_reality">standard reality</Link>, for which <Link path="/mawanet/narraphysic_realm">narraphysic realm</Link> is delegated to it's hypothetically compactified dimensions while retaining it's Standard Model conformity.

Within <Link path="/mawanet/standard_reality">standard reality</Link> resonances are manifested through <Link path="/mawanet/breach">breach's</Link> as inner <Link path="/mawanet/local_reality">local realities</Link> and as release of/transformation to <Link path="/mawanet/exhaust">exhaust</Link>, both scenarios releasing energy which coincides to energy used to previously open a <Link path="/mawanet/breach">breach</Link> or perform matter manipulation over <Link path="/mawanet/narraphysic_realm">narraphysic realm</Link>, i.e. <Link path="/mawanet/superimposition_event">superimposition</Link>.

### Energy Paradox

Both scenarios show that resonances possess a potential energy which is released from <Link path="/mawanet/narraphysic_realm">narraphysic realm</Link> serving as a pool to pull from borrowed energy, behaving as a subset of vacuum energy delegated to this category of matter manipulation. This creates a paradox consisting of resonances which can arrive over a <Link path="/mawanet/breach">breach</Link> and release their energy in unrestricted amounts to make up for an energy costs of interactions with the <Link path="/mawanet/narraphysic_realm">narraphysic realm</Link> originating from the macroworld.

Inside the <Link path="/mawanet/narraphysic_realm">narraphysic realm</Link> resonances existed in a network of interconnected nodes of configurations of space-time, configurations of potential vacuums not existing whithin current <Link path="/mawanet/standard_reality">standard reality</Link>. Across this space an organised behavior of resonances emerges -- vacuums currently abscent from <Link path="/mawanet/standard_reality">standard reality</Link> including <Link path="/mawanet/breach">breach</Link> attemp to manifest once they enter a <Link path="/mawanet/breach">breach</Link> as an instance of <Link path="/mawanet/local_reality">local reality</Link>.

### Resonance Decay

see: <Link path="/mawanet/local_reality">local reality</Link>, <Link path="/mawanet/exhaust">exhaust</Link>

resoannce decay is a phenomenon when resoannce passes into a <Link path="/mawanet/breach">breach</Link> and during emerging in it's puter layers decays to a local vacuum represented by it's composing strings as a <Link path="/mawanet/local_reality">local reality</Link> derivating from a <Link path="/mawanet/standard_reality">standard reality</Link>. If resonance does not has a required momnetum or range of vacuum's properties to adapt to <Link path="/mawanet/standard_reality">standard reality</Link>, it reeamins as alocal reality within a breach, else it persists, lack of greater <Link path="/mawanet/altered_field_presence">altered field presence</Link> causes to local vacuum with traces of original resoannce to further decay into a flow of excited particles within a specific configuration of vacuum - releasing as <Link path="/mawanet/exhaust">exhaust</Link>.

### Resonance Sentience

It is possible that this potential entities on a some layer exist with the rest of the vacuum and once are observed from a breach they 'gain' their sentience and even consciousness in a goal to phase through the <Link path="/mawanet/breach">breach</Link> in order to physically manifest within <Link path="/mawanet/standard_reality">standard reality</Link>. It may be possible that thay attempt to imprint it's configuration on the parent vacuum and expand beyond borders of <Link path="/mawanet/local_reality">local reality</Link> -- outside of a breach, in an event resulting in creation of a new spacial vacuum, and decay of previous one.

This interpretation of resoannce sentience is based on the fact that entities such as <Link path="/mawanet/ghost">ghosts</Link>, and <Link path="/mawanet/conceptual_configuration">conceptual configurations</Link> exist and retain their physical counterpart properties, as well as the phenomenon of <Link path="/mawanet/superimposition_event">superimposition event</Link>, shich manipulates these entities across <Link path="/mawanet/narraphysic_realm">narraphysic realm</Link>, as well as supposed nature of the <Link path="/mawanet/ultracomplex">ultracomplex</Link> being a narraphysic entity.
