# Unbound

Unbound is a case of <Link path="/mawanet/revenant">revenant</Link> which was unbound from it's physical body and it's consciousness and <Link path="/mawanet/conceptual_configuration">conceptual configuration</Link> are transformed to a self-sustaining equilibrium residing across both physical <Link path="/mawanet/standard_reality">standard reality</Link> and the <Link path="/mawanet/narraphysic_realm">narraphysic realm</Link> via <Link path="/mawanet/accursed_framework">accursed framework</Link>.

Unbound's physical body when percieved directly posesses several memetic characteristics govern by the <Link path="/mawanet/observer">observer's</Link> perception of the entity observed which grants the latter full understanding of it's perception which it then can alter directly. This pattern reportedly results in it not obeying to both <Link path="/mawanet/standard_reality">standard reality's</Link> physical laws or causality, but rather govern by pricipals of perceived <Link path="/mawanet/narrative">narrative</Link>'s virtual interpretation superseded by unbound's own will.

As mentioned earlier, unbound's <Link path="/mawanet/conceptual_configuration">conceptual configuration</Link> which anchors it inside the <Link path="/mawanet/narraphysic_realm">narraphysic realm</Link> is merged with it's consciousness/regular identity, this phenomenon is observed directly when unbound's body is either abscent or it is communicating across the <Link path="/mawanet/narraphysic_realm">narraphysic realm</Link> - the communications take form narraphysic symbols manifested in reality as narratives - including but to limited to:

- manipultaion of <Link path="/mawanet/standard_reality">standard reality</Link>/<Link path="/mawanet/local_reality">local reality</Link>'s casuality through applied narratives with the target being either a participant or an <Link path="/mawanet/observer">observer</Link>
- interception of the transmutations performed through the <Link path="/mawanet/accursed_framework">accursed framework</Link>
