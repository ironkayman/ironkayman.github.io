# Altered Field Presence

Altered Field Presence is a term of measuring the difference in vacuum potential to transition to a vacuum of different composition and energy defined by an underlying <Link path="/mawanet/narraphysic_realm">narraphysic realm</Link>. It acts as a mathematical probabilistic formulae for calculation of <Link path="/mawanet/breach">breach</Link>'s area of influence and occurence and subsiquently <Link path="/mawanet/narraphysic_realm">narraphysic realm</Link> presence and density within a specific region of <Link path="/mawanet/standard_reality">standard reality</Link> at a set point of space-time.

### Vacuum Energy Pool

Energy taken both to initiate - prepare portion of <Link path="/mawanet/narraphysic_realm">narraphysic realm</Link>, and to transfer physical objects over <Link path="/mawanet/superimposition_event">superimposition mechanism</Link> is borrowed from, initially, vacuum, up to a limit, when difference withn the vacuums' energies causes a <Link path="/mawanet/breach">breach</Link> to form as, supposedly, a thermodynamic mechanism preventing localised change of vacuum energy. Once breach is formed, replenishment of vacuum energy is conteolled by a parity of <Link path="/mawanet/narraphysic_realm">narraphysic realm</Link> and a <Link path="/mawanet/breach">breach</Link>.

#### Vacuum Synchronisation

An initiator of the transfer may also preemptively input required energy into the vacuum before the <Link path="/mawanet/superimposition_event">superimposition event</Link>, though an input of additional energy into the vacuum prevents a greater possibility of vacuum decay, requires near perfect synchronisation of the input and transfer during superimposition. Failure of the synchronisation, additional energy would be taken as usual, lowering AFP and increasing possibility of <Link path="/mawanet/breach">breach</Link> appearing.

The latter of the 2-step process consisting from calculating of the exact amount of energy required to perform superimposion and then passing required energy into a vacuum just in time for the superimposition mechanism to consider the input, lessening amount of volume with lowered vacuum, is referred as the _vacuum synchronisation_.

#### Narraphysic drain

In a scenario when not enough energy is passed into a vacuum either due to lack of the required energy or [[#Vacuum Synchronisation]] failure, - in order to restore energy taken by <Link path="/mawanet/superimposition_event">superimposition event</Link> the **<Link path="/mawanet/narraphysic_realm">narraphysic realm</Link> itself will bring portion of vacuum to a lower energy state in proximity of the area of superimposition**.

The process of replenishment then is achieved through, regardless of volume of space superimposed, creation of a <Link path="/mawanet/breach">breach</Link> - an establishment of a transitory connection between non-compcated dimensions of minkowski space and an array of compacted dimensions composing <Link path="/mawanet/narraphysic_realm">narraphysic realm</Link>. The <Link path="/mawanet/resonance">resonances</Link> residing within the <Link path="/mawanet/narraphysic_realm">narraphysic realm</Link> are then made real as they are driven outside of <Link path="/mawanet/narraphysic_realm">narraphysic realm</Link>, becoming non-potential measurable packets of energy. Then, these resonances, at transitional boundary of a <Link path="/mawanet/breach">breach</Link> - marked as <Link path="/mawanet/breach">breach</Link>, - are annihilated to replenish the vacuum debt itself. During annihilation their compostion is released as <Link path="/mawanet/exhaust">exhaust</Link> which makes up the contents of a <Link path="/mawanet/breach">breached volume</Link>, it's shape, topology, and properties.

While <Link path="/mawanet/resonance">resonaces</Link> seemingly restricted to compacted dimensions of <Link path="/mawanet/narraphysic_realm">narraphysic realm</Link>, once transition into non-compact dimensions of minkowski space, are utilised to serve as a source for <Link path="/mawanet/superimposition_event">superimposition</Link>/[[#Vacuum Energy Pool]] balancing, they continue to exist or leave matter of <Link path="/mawanet/exhaust">exhaust</Link>, now static in it's properties.

Once the energy balance is fulfilled, a breach dissolves, leaving residual altered field presence. Subsiquently, altered field presence differs within areas previously taken by the <Link path="/mawanet/breach">breach</Link> or where superimposition, since these are points of direct contact with <Link path="/mawanet/narraphysic_realm">narraphysic realm</Link>.

#### Vacuum decay

During a preiod of energy replenishment though a breach, space-time around it becomes inclined to fall into a lower energy state permanently in an event called _vacuum decay_.

With the analysis of the <Link path="/mawanet/astrolab">Astrolab</Link> over it's <Link path="/mawanet/armillary_sphere">armillary spheres</Link> and it being a cause behind <Link path="/mawanet/breached_wasteland">breached wasteland</Link> and followed vacuum decay suggests that AFP is connected to a probability of a vacuum decay occuring. More precisely - an area of space-time in proximity to a <Link path="/mawanet/breach">breach</Link> possesses greater AFP and potential of transitioning to a lower energy state, as well as the breach itself is large enough to allow for vacuum decay to occure at it's borders, where transition between vacuums is minimal, causing a formation of bubble of lower vacuum.
