# Altered Field Presence (AFP)

see: <Link path="/mawanet/narraphysic_realm">narraphysic realm</Link>, <Link path="/mawanet/breach">breach</Link>, <Link path="/mawanet/superimposition_event">superimposition event</Link>

Mathematical probabilistic formulae for calculation of <Link path="/mawanet/breach">breach</Link>'s area of influence and occurence and subsiquently <Link path="/mawanet/narraphysic_realm">narraphysic realm</Link> presence and density within a specific region of <Link path="/mawanet/standard_reality">standard reality</Link> at a set point of space-time.

### The Vacuum Energy Pool

Energy taken to both initiate and transfer objects during <Link path="/mawanet/superimposition_event">superimposition</Link> is borrowed from <Link path="/mawanet/narraphysic_realm">narraphysic realm</Link> if not enough energy is inputted to restore the potential energy balance within <Link path="/mawanet/narraphysic_realm">narraphysic realm</Link> which will bring portions of volume of space-time to lower energy state in places around superimposed objects, removing that volume, or, in case of larger areas/energy requirements will create spacial folds refered to as <Link path="/mawanet/breach">breaches</Link> which though manifestation of <Link path="/mawanet/resonance">resonances</Link> restore energy balance and ones finished thay dissolve.

Subsiquently, AFP differs within areas of <Link path="/mawanet/breach">breaches</Link> present or where breachlesss superimposition had taken place since these are the points of direct contact with the <Link path="/mawanet/narraphysic_realm">narraphysic realm</Link>.

The case may be, that the energy source from which all manipulation happen may drain potential energy from the <Link path="/mawanet/narraphysic_realm">narraphysic realm</Link>, the vacuum which contains the <Link path="/mawanet/narraphysic_realm">narraphysic realm</Link>, which should be replenished either from regular vacuum by an actor of such manipulation or taken by <Link path="/mawanet/narraphysic_realm">narraphysic realm</Link> from the physical reality/space-time as part of it's volume converted to energy. Usually some amount of energy is lost during actor's transfer which leads to 2 scenarios of energy replenishment by <Link path="/mawanet/narraphysic_realm">narraphysic realm</Link>.

At microscopic scale this changes are temporal in a form of altered topology which is dissapated over time with a residual AFP spike, but at a larger scales volume of space-time is replaces with a <Link path="/mawanet/breach">breach</Link> in place of it. The breach in this case takes form of a lower energy vacuum being dissolved into a portion of <Link path="/mawanet/narraphysic_realm">narraphysic realm</Link>, and as energy carrying <Link path="/mawanet/resonance">resonances</Link> emerge from it, breach's internal topology and physical properties are altered as the potntial energy is replenished this way with it's volume transitioning into <Link path="/mawanet/narraphysic_realm">narraphysic realm</Link>. AS the potential energy is restored, a breach dissolves, leaving residual AFP.

#### Vacuum decay

During a presiod o energy replenishment though a breach, space-time around it becomes inclined to fall into a lower energy state permanently as vacuum decay.

With the analysis of the <Link path="/mawanet/astrolab">Astrolab</Link> over it's <Link path="/mawanet/armillary_sphere">armillary spheres</Link> and it being a cause behind <Link path="/mawanet/breached_wasteland">breached wasteland</Link> and followed vacuum decay suggests that AFP is connected to a probability of a vacuum decay occuring. More precisely -- an area of space-time in proximity of a <Link path="/mawanet/breach">breach</Link> possesses greater AFP as it is near a breach as well as the breach itself is large enough to allow for vacuum decay to occure at it's borders, where transition between vacuums is minimal, causing an uncontained reation to emerge.
