# Narrative



Narrative is a multi-tenant construct consisting of <Link path="/mawanet/narreme">narremes</Link>-<Link path="/mawanet/resonance">resonances</Link>.

Since introduction of <Link path="/mawanet/narraphysic_realm">narraphysic realm</Link> they possess similar features as concepts in an ontological sence: they can be percieved, acted upon, changed and understood.

> Yet, this interpretation allow to grasp it only as an abstraction of the physical processes underlying the NR though a flawed lens of intercations more common across spient entities and their consciousnesses.

## Virtual Interpretation

Most prominents idea is that when a narrative is precieved, the <Link path="/mawanet/observer">observer</Link>, based on known to him information regarding the narrative, constructs his own version of a narrative the way he interpreted it. Its a virtual interpretation of a narrative (VI).

The idea of a narrative's concept, its shape, can be either an avarage of all it's interpretations by observers or each VI is a derivate of a single abstract/ideal concept of a narrative as-is.

This leads to a creation of a relative power of an interpretation to influence upon a narrative and it's interpretation observer's role as an actor inside a narrative, since there is no stric border when such enclosed system ends.

## Ideal

Concepts do not posess a core properties (see classical theory of concepts, all concepts have inherit core properties unchanging from which veiwpoint its inspected upon) since it is fuzzy by it's nature, while narrative's properties are under the hood an array of concepts, narremes, archetypes and myths -- here the narrative serves as a line that affirms and filters interpretations of a concepts which do not conform to a narrative's fabula itself, making narrative similar to a myth which can be intepreted only in finite amount of ways by analysing its syuzhet.
