# Revenant

Revenent is an entity which had perished while inside of a <Link path="/mawanet/local_reality">local reality</Link> or <Link path="/mawanet/breach">breach</Link>'s compromised area and was reanimated though alchemical means. In order to revive it's consciousness had to be preserved through <Link path="/mawanet/narraphysics">narraphysic</Link>/alchemical means inside of a body, which must be altered to retain the latter, and then a reanimation is performed. Resulting mental faculties are usually lessened by a state of brain cells.

If the host's physical body was annihilated, the latter reanimated entity will be <Link path="/mawanet/paraexhumed">paraexhumed</Link> since the process of reanimation is delegated to initiation from within <Link path="/mawanet/narraphysic_realm">narraphysic realm</Link> rather than by an actor of <Link path="/mawanet/standard_reality">standard reality</Link>.
