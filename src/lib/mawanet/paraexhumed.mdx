# Paraexhumed

Paraexhumed or paraexhumation is a physical process of a sentient entity reconstructed after being annihilated during the passage of <Link path="/mawanet/breach">breach</Link>'s <Link path="/mawanet/breach">Heaven Gates</Link> while it's consceousness, or rather it's idea in a form of <Link path="/mawanet/conceptual_configuration">conceptual configuration</Link>, -- was kept intact in a constantly changing vacuum beyond the <Link path="/mawanet/breach">Eidos</Link> of sequential passage of <Link path="/mawanet/breach">breach's</Link> <Link path="/mawanet/local_reality">local realities</Link> up to <Link path="/mawanet/breach">Planar Realm</Link>.

The hypothecial scenario described above suggests that while typically the consciousness will fade the moment it's carrier (the physical brain) will experience high enough difference of vacuum properties characterised by an entrace into a <Link path="/mawanet/local_reality">local reality</Link> which would likely disrupt brain tissues' molecular and atomic bonds, at that moment consciousness could be preserved through a process of continious physical adaptation/reconstruction of matter to support high-order functions.

When such structure enters planar realm, it is targeted by now revealed entities of <Link path="/mawanet/narraphysic_realm">narraphysic realm</Link>. Another hypothetical scenario suggests that the disturbances of planar realm could be soften as the consciousness would be mapped onto <Link path="/mawanet/conceptual_configuration">conceptual configuration</Link> in order to match it's movements and subsequently reducing it's detectable presence overall.

As at it's base it is a group of <Link path="/mawanet/resonance">resonances</Link> the scenario is percieved as a concelation of their vibrations. If at that point the entity was already attacked by hostile concepts of <Link path="/mawanet/narraphysic_realm">narraphysic realm</Link> and it's <Link path="/mawanet/conceptual_configuration">conceptual configuration</Link> is hijacked, then it rreemerjes regualry as any other breach-native entity, is called paraexhumed.

It is theorised, that the requirement of preserved consciousness is satisfied due to presence of the <Link path="/mawanet/doomsphere">Doomsphere</Link> which at areas of <Link path="/mawanet/altered_field_presence">altered field presence</Link> can observe and capture perished entities.

## Death Repatriation

Death repatriation (paraexhumed deathly repatriated entities, PAEREs) is a state of a paraexhumed entity which was directly influenced by the <Link path="/mawanet/doomsphere">Doomsphere</Link> as it's vector of development, and, as a result becoming <Link path="/mawanet/death_drive">Entities of Death</Link>.

Effects of this state are for the most part coincide with ones of the <Link path="/mawanet/doomsphere">Doomsphere</Link> itself while lessenede in their intensity and percieved effects.

## Reviered

A hypothetical derivation of paraexhumed entities which were brough back to <Link path="/mawanet/standard_reality">standard reality</Link> over means other that presence of the <Link path="/mawanet/doomsphere">Doomsphere</Link>. This state suggests that the ooriginal consciousness is untempered with, becoming approximatly close in it's nature to an <Link path="/mawanet/unbound">unbound</Link>.
