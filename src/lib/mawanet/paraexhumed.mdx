# Paraexhumed

Paraexhumed is a result of a physical process of a sentient entity being reconstructed after annihilation within <Link path="/mawanet/breach">breach</Link>'s Heaven Gates while it's consciousness, or rather it's idea in form of <Link path="/mawanet/conceptual_configuration">conceptual configuration</Link>, was kept intact in a constantly changing vacuum beyond the <Link path="/mawanet/breach">Eidos</Link> of sequential passage of <Link path="/mawanet/breach">breach's</Link> <Link path="/mawanet/local_reality">local realities</Link> up to <Link path="/mawanet/breach">precipice Realm</Link>.

The hypothecial scenario described above suggests that while typically the consciousness will fade the moment it's carrier (the physical brain) will experience high enough difference of vacuum properties characterised by an entrace into a <Link path="/mawanet/local_reality">local reality</Link> which would likely disrupt brain tissues' molecular and atomic bonds, at that moment consciousness could be preserved through a process of continious physical adaptation/reconstruction of matter to support high-order functions.

When such structure enters precipice realm, it is targeted by now revealed entities of <Link path="/mawanet/narraphysic_realm">narraphysic realm</Link>.

Another hypothetical scenario suggests that the disturbances of precipice realm could be soften as the consciousness would be mapped onto <Link path="/mawanet/conceptual_configuration">conceptual configuration</Link> in order to match it's movements and subsequently reducing it's detectable presence overall.

As at it's base it is a group of <Link path="/mawanet/resonance">resonances</Link> the scenario is percieved as a concelation of their vibrations. If at that point the entity was already attacked by hostile concepts of <Link path="/mawanet/narraphysic_realm">narraphysic realm</Link> and **it's <Link path="/mawanet/conceptual_configuration">conceptual configuration</Link> is hijacked**, then it emerges as any other breach-native entity, is called paraexhumed.

It is theorised, that the requirement of preserved consciousness is satisfied due to presence of the <Link path="/mawanet/great_work">great work</Link> which at areas of <Link path="/mawanet/altered_field_presence">altered field presence</Link> can observe and capture perished entities.

## Death Repatriation

Death repatriation (paraexhumed deathly repatriated entities, PAEREs) is a state of a paraexhumed entity which was directly influenced by the <Link path="/mawanet/doomsphere">Doomsphere</Link> as it's vector of development, and, as a result becoming a vessel for an <Link path="/mawanet/death_drive">Entity of Death</Link>.

Effects of this state are for the most part coincide with ones of the <Link path="/mawanet/doomsphere">Doomsphere</Link> itself while lessenede in their intensity and percieved effects.

## Reviered

A hypothetical derivation of paraexhumed entities which were brough back to <Link path="/mawanet/standard_reality">standard reality</Link> over means other that presence of the <Link path="/mawanet/doomsphere">Doomsphere</Link> - a possible influence of the <Link path="/mawanet/great_work">great work</Link>. This state suggests that the original consciousness is untempered with, becoming approximatly close in it's nature to an <Link path="/mawanet/unbound">unbound</Link>.

## Starborn

<Link path="/mawanet/revenant">Revenants</Link> that became paraexhumed within area on influence of the <Link path="/mawanet/doomsphere">Doomsphere</Link> are called starborn. Paraexhumed Revenats of the Great Work do not transfigure under it's influence - this observation suggests that Starborn are a vector of <Link path="/mawanet/doomsphere">Doomsphere's</Link> developemnt and influence.

Starborn posess structure close in composition to the doomsphere itself, and refered conceptually as the **cosmic flesh**. Starborn usually posess burners - n areas of buring cosmic flesh, shose smoke contains extreme amount of hordholl which forms whithin it's inner volume _visions of cosmos_ initiated by the doomsphere as a method of direct observance - <Link path="/mawanet/breach">breaches</Link> from which these paraexhumed emerged but contained within existence of the bearer.

Internal anbalysis suggests that originally starborn had an internally hidden breach which served as a direct connnction with the Doomsphere, but in order to better blend within areas covered by <Link path="/mawanet/maelstrom_watchtower">maelstrom watchtowers</Link> they perish the burners and any other breach-like extensions and started to accumuate information within itself, which led themselves to re-develop a brain and sentience, and, finally, rudimental consciousness - herein great acceleration and mental development is made possible due to original <Link path="/mawanet/revenant">revenant's</Link> state of the brain, from which further development is made.
