# Conceptual Configuration

Conceptual Configuration is a multi-dimensional topological structure inside the <Link path="/mawanet/narraphysic_realm">narraphysic realm</Link> consisting of one or more <Link path="/mawanet/narrative">narrative</Link> interacting through <Link path="/mawanet/perception_particle">perception particles</Link> over an <Link path="/mawanet/altered_field_presence">altered field presence</Link> with physical entities.

This structure usually corresponts to a sentient entity or an entity with a <Link path="/mawanet/narrative">narrative</Link> which was present within area of <Link path="/mawanet/altered_field_presence">altered field presence</Link>. Conceptual configuration may be considered a separate entity under certain curcumstances, in case of being decoupled from non-compact physical entity/reality.

This <Link path="/mawanet/standard_reality">standard reality</Link>-<Link path="/mawanet/narraphysic_realm">narraphysic realm</Link> connection has a bi-directional feedback which may change as <Link path="/mawanet/altered_field_presence">altered field presence</Link> changes. Conceptual configuration consists of virtually present <Link path="/mawanet/narrative">narrative</Link> and correponding <Link path="/mawanet/narreme">narremes</Link> which in their total represent the idea of a consceousness inside of a <Link path="/mawanet/standard_reality">standard reality</Link> at a discrete moment in time.

While across physical <Link path="/mawanet/standard_reality">standard reality</Link>, conceptual configuration corresponds with the momentary archetypes contributing to ideas and concepts to a degree allowed by the <Link path="/mawanet/altered_field_presence">altered field presence</Link>, -- everything is represented as highly abstract <Link path="/mawanet/narrative">narrative</Link>s whose flow and interconnectedness inside the <Link path="/mawanet/narraphysic_realm">narraphysic realm</Link> partially effects further continuation.

One could say that the entire concept, or rather, the interpretation is mostly fatalistic since the authority over the decisions is placed upon yet abstract, but still connected, entities of loose casuality labeled as narratives. While this is a highly plausible conclusion, it's nontheless important to ackowledge that the physicality of these entities is govern from highly abstracted and for the most part compactifed dimensins, taking real steering within an <Link path="/mawanet/altered_field_presence">altered field presence</Link> wherein <Link path="/mawanet/narraphysic_realm">narraphysic realm</Link> has a much greater potential conncetion.

Yet there is an another scenario, the case of absolute authority over the one's will and as a result, puppeteering the presence of specific archetypal attributes of consciousness, through an continious narrative, whose larger scale allows it to directly affect an encompassed reality.
