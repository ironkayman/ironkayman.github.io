# Death drive

> Ð¡onceptualise nonexistence. Simply dying is not enough as there is no "you" to percieve this reality, the totality of your identity must be present in some respect. And so, then, a need to surpass death emerges. This state of un-being is beyond death's disarming threshhold, a state while unobservable, - it must be witnessed consciously.
>
> There is no horizon.
>
> Now imagine in this metaphysical space an entire kingdom, empires of unlife, -- a system infused with death, of negation, yet comprised of same familiar physical concepts of same kingdoms and orders of life, of fungi, animals, plants, microbes, a vastness of cellular life flourishing in shade. It can venture into the world of matter, that's how we perceive it's similarity to ours.
>
> These entities of death usually nonexist and incapable of being perceived, but when noticed, and the observer is made aware of them, they carry out an incursion into world of Being in order to erase the observer, bring about the Unbeing.
>
> With the Doomsphere, with awareness of it, these entites laid bare in sight. And they responded with an endless conquest onto Being. With the conquest malevolence arraived as a capacity to, seemingly, _hate_ that Being. All these aspects, with malevolence present within it and made archetypical, became instrumental to a defined concept of life driven by death, - a death drive.

Death drive is a source for unlife, a set of lifeforms which have at their base an archetype of death, introduced into <Link path="/mawanet/standard_reality">reality</Link> from <Link path="/mawanet/narraphysic_realm">narraphysic realm</Link> with formation of the <Link path="/mawanet/doomsphere">Doomsphere</Link>.

[[#Entities of Death]] are categorised by the same pricipals which form modern taxonomy ranking systems with a few derivations.

Originally refered to strictly in psychological matters, since the discovery of <Link path="/mawanet/narraphysics">narraphysics</Link> the term had gained it's narraphysic equivalent - as one of many archetypal <Link path="/mawanet/conceptual_configuration">concepts</Link> within <Link path="/mawanet/narraphysic_realm">narraphysic realm</Link>.

Death drive preserves it's original psychological and physiological tendencies while building upon itself as an abstract archetypal force in accordance to <Link path="/mawanet/memetic_field">memetic field</Link> properties of <Link path="/mawanet/narraphysic_realm">narraphysic realm</Link> of a will of destruction and absolute negation.

Despite it's omnious nature if present at rather avarage <Link path="/mawanet/altered_field_presence">altered field presence</Link> values it behaves similar to it's psychological counterpart, but if <Link path="/mawanet/altered_field_presence">altered field presence</Link> rises, it's manifestation can form, as with any <Link path="/mawanet/conceptual_configuration">conceptual configuration</Link>, making it's influence more detectable, as well as allowing for [[#Entities of Death]] to enter the <Link path="/mawanet/standard_reality">standard reality</Link>.

In case of <Link path="/mawanet/ekhinill">Ekhinill</Link> and it's <Link path="/mawanet/standard_reality">standard reality</Link>, Death Drive effect is focused within an entity which is, up to certain degree, is a manmade manifestation of this <Link path="/mawanet/conceptual_configuration">conceptual configuration</Link> - <Link path="/mawanet/doomsphere">Doomsphere</Link>.





### Entities of Death

Nature of Death drive is similar to one of <Link path="/mawanet/malevelent_presence">Malevelent Presence</Link>, while the latter is less researched and more abstract, it is still intrumental to the <Link path="/mawanet/narraphysic_realm">narraphysic realm</Link>, due to it's nature possibly related to <Link path="/mawanet/engine_of_narraphysic_gliding">engine of narraphysic gliding</Link>.

This suggests that entities of death could exist within narraphysic realm as <Link path="/mawanet/resonance">resonances</Link> and it's manifestations when found outside of <Link path="/mawanet/narraphysic_realm">narraphysic realm</Link>/<Link path="/mawanet/breach">breaches</Link>. <Link path="/mawanet/doomsphere">Doomsphere</Link> is considered as one of such entity of death.
