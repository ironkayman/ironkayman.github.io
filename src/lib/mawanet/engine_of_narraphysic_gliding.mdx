# Engine of narraphysic gliding

see: <Link path="/mawanet/acropolis">Acropolis</Link>

The Engine of narraphysic gliding is a primary method of propagation and source of energy for the <Link path="/mawanet/acropolis">Acropolis</Link> entities.

## Origins

Multiple theories were introduced over time to expalain the reason behind <Link path="/mawanet/malevelent_presence">malevelent presence</Link>. Most prominent of them are listed down below in chronological order.

### A Vacuum-embeded entity and the Anthropic principle

The Engine alters properties of a <Link path="/mawanet/standard_reality">standard reality</Link> which results in a emergence of permanent to this vacuum high-concept laws. This laws should be capable enough to preserve conceptual entities with a purpose of the Engine, or it's idea, being represented through them.

The concept of the Engine - currently theorised to be the <Link path="/mawanet/malevelent_presence">malevelent presence</Link> within <Link path="/mawanet/standard_reality">standard reality</Link> - is reproduced across multiple vacuum through alterations of these vacua.

This behavior may be described as following: a goal is set of creating life - how a vacuum should be constructed and fine-tuned, and under what circumstances a patch of space amy develop to result in life's creation in any specific form?

#### The concept

Now, what if a totality of life's representations was abstracted to a set of universal, for the total, statements which characterise and distinguish it from anything else what is not considered alive. The entire specter of these statements now we transform to a goal to persuit which will naturally emerge over time, so the result will always be an emergence of a concept of life. Now place under the concept of life mentioned earlier <Link path="/mawanet/malevelent_presence">malevelent presence</Link> - a form of life, developing and spreading across vacua. At this point the original concept is driven indistinguishable from a law of physics - that is the result.

This scenario toushes upon the anthropic principle which in our <Link path="/mawanet/standard_reality">standard reality</Link> bound to the Presence is resolved, but does it gets resolved for the earlier vacuum from which the presence arrived?

#### Architecture

The Engine should propagate itself through the border of distinguishable vacuums while present in a first one and embedding itself as coceptual emergent reincarnation of itself in the next one - as stated above, the Engine should exist as one of vacuum's physical laws.

A proposed method of Engine's propagation requires, under known physcal laws, an acceptance of eternal vacuum decay architecture of universe. Under this proposition a universal "trigger of decay" should exist which both initiates a vacuum decay with a configuratiion which rebuilds the foundations of physics inside to be functionally capable of recreating, preserving the idea of, an Engine in any shape or form.

The event of vacuum decay happening inside a universe is the event of traversing through a String Landscape by changing its scalar values, or, from the perspective of a vacuum - shifting through a Landscape.

##### Solustion

Yet we encounder problem of information passthrough over the horizon - this is currently solved with an introduction of a theory of <Link path="/mawanet/narraphysic_realm">Narraphysic Realm</Link> which has capacity to sustain an ecosystem/hierarchy of virtual entities similar to ideas or concepts only intersecting with vacuums when invoced from them. A point of this invocation may be revealed only in a moment/state of changing vacuum's properties - inside the vacuum decay domain wall. This may allows for information transfer beyond the domain wall as proprties of a new vacuum.

#### The Purpose

Constant decay can lead to a state of zero potential energy signifying that a universe can decay to a lower vacuum and remain there - this state is undesirable by the Engine, and so there is another option - a possibility of ascencion to a higher potential vacuum energy state through same process of decay - an <Link path="/mawanet/vacuum_ascention">vacuum ascention</Link>. The Engine may need to 'map out' the path of potentian elevations across the String Landscape and avoid falling to the supersymmetic vacuum below. The whole of an infinitely high potential energy vacuums is reffered to as the Aleph Maelstrom Assembly.

#### Process of decay: Vacuum's Narraphysic Realm

Now we established that NR is a realm of conceptual entities and engine may use it for the transmission of itself. Once the information, which is the properties allowing for it to exist, is transmitted, it becomes a law - a concept - embedded to the concrete vacuum. It may not interlap with the rest of the NR or interact with it but rather be restricted to the volume of the universe.

Next, the Engine orchestrates it's manifestation in a new vacuum through a construction of a physical device which will be a <Link path="/mawanet/superimposition_event">avatar</Link> and a means of passing Engine's concept into a new vacuum. The process, this <Link path="/mawanet/exodus_event">exodus event</Link>, is completed with any of aforementioned results: falling to the lowest vacuum, ascending or perishing due to any reason. An analogy with life also applies here since to begin <Link path="/mawanet/superimposition_event">superimposition event</Link>, a connection with the <Link path="/mawanet/narraphysic_realm">narraphysic realm</Link> should be established from previous vacuum by the builder's of the device -- currently there is no known solution to perform this complex chain of events successfully - and requires adoption of a concscious-bearing reality with all underlying requirements for a complex chemistry to exist.

Notably, which is yet to be proven, a variation of vacuum may exist - a "keystone vacuum", - which may require not a consciousness or a civilisation of builders to exist for the construction of the avatar for the manifestation of the Engine to arrive.

- Outer Memetic Expance - multitude of concepts to whcish engine is _not_ attuned to.
- Memetic Composite - identity of an engine encodeed to array of concepts and archetypes, to be applied to a reality.
