# Salt Sarcophaguses

> An economy built on alchemical meaning manifested and  perpetuated by cursed ekhnillian souls sealed deep beneath the ground, beyond the tallest mountains and deepest of caverns, possibly even reachhing hell of flesh itself in a masoned halls of stone labyrinths.

Salt Sarcophaguses of <Link path="/mawanet/ekhinill">Ekhinill</Link> are sealed chambers of alchemically mummified <Link path="/mawanet/maelstrom_watchtower">Operators</Link> which maintain <Link path="/mawanet/kinetic_neurosymbolics">neurosymbolic</Link> meaning of <Link path="/mawanet/runes">runes</Link> in order for them to preserve internal energy similar to <Link path="/mawanet/hordholl">hordholl</Link> crystalls.
