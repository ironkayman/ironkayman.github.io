# Narraphysic Isolation Environment

Narraphysic Isolation EnviRonment, or NIER, is a hardware and software modular solution built into every produced elecronic device with a purpose of protecting the object placed or connected with -- that being either hardware components of the computer or a running software from a possibility of seamless conceptual invasion, <Link path="/mawanet/superimposition_event">superimposition event</Link>, and other infohazardous effects of the <Link path="/mawanet/breach">breaches'</Link> compromised area.

### Chained Secure Enclave Layering

Chained Secure Enclave Layering is a system allowing for connection and secure passage of memetic/narrativistic information across multiple separated Narraphysic Isolation Environments in a layered fasion. The model presents a secure enclave between each horizontal or vertical pair of NIERs.

## Origins

NIER was for the first time developed one <Link path="/mawanet/ekhinill">Ekhinill</Link> as a technology that would at the time theoritically, rather protect the pilot connecting to the iterfaces of <Link path="/mawanet/armillary_sphere">armillary sphere</Link>, but that technilogy was gone and resurfaced only some time after formation of <Link path="/mawanet/erkholl">erkholl</Link>. During that time other instances of this spectrum of technologies was developed orienting singlehandedly on abstraction of specific information from <Link path="/mawanet/breach">breach</Link>'s detrimental to information integrity effects.

### Astrolab's simulation driver

Very fact that <Link path="/mawanet/astrolab">Astrolab</Link> had simulated star's development seemingly to the very precision required by reality it was present in, it may be possible that armillary sphere used some solution for abstracting tested reality, separating it physically from the outside, yet this internal (simulated) universes still could not be brought into Astrolab's time's present <Link path="/mawanet/standard_reality">standard reality</Link>, having a capacity only to communicate and observe it without direct or rapid intervention.
