_"A Monstrous Research"_

</SubTitleCentered>

This document is meant to group elements of Spiral Knights' worldbuilding and lore into cohesive narratives within the context of singular timeline of the game while focusing on the main themes and motifs in attempt to achieve narratively satisfying closure for the presented story.

## Preface

It is important to note, that at no point the timeline is considered a single true representation of events, but rather is a series of educated guesses based on game's content, - a theory, that achieves thematic consistency and a certain level of narrative satisfaction. The resulting timeline presented further is an interpretation of those findings.

But before that, 3 assumptions are made:

1. Rise of Knights is **not used** in the construction of the timeline due to being a cancelled project, unobtainable through regular means.
2. Cut content is considered **not canon**, for example:
   - Clockworks design was originally different, such as the Arcade Pillars and Clockwork elevators. While this is true, golden key platforms are still used despite having older, steampunk-inspired design.
   - Shadow Lairs enemy designs were finalized through, at least, 1 iteration of the concept, with some older instances of shadow-themed enemies not currently used.
3. **Recipes are diegetic**. Crafting or, as it is called, alchemy of the gear is done with the intended materials from an in-universe perspective and is historically accurate within the setting.

As for the inspirations, relations to real world history, folklore and mythology, they will be brought up wherein we believe they stand as a potential inspiration for the motifs presented in the work of fiction within a specified context.

Of course, this space of theory-crafting stems from an idea that the analyzed work has ambiguities, left out information, and unanswered questions, that require resolution. It is the nature of those blanks, or even logical contradictions and paradoxes within the work of fiction itself, paired with its themes and general feel, which create conditions for a generally accepted degree of seriousness and thought put into a theory with a capacity to acknowledge some cases as <a href="https://tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/HandWave" target="_blank">hand waves</a>. This process is accompanied by a constant risk of interpreting and suggesting a meaning that was never thought or implied by the author, as the guesswork itself contains a subjective element.

With this foundation for a framework with aforementioned risks in mind, we will go through our proposed timeline of events for the universe of Spiral Knights, backed by the analysis of every dialogue, item description, items' designs, the symbolism, the connections, perceived as relevant to a current topic in order to present a cohesive story.

While this thought framework partially relies on myths and folklore of different real-world cultures, it remains subjective, as a level of vagueness in interpretation persists due to undiscovered mythological inspirations or unawareness of those by the authors of this document. To resolve these issues, logical leaps and assumptions as well as thematic narrative analysis are required.

Through the course of this document we will propose why Spiral Knights, or rather _Cradle itself, is a metaphor on the alchemical Great Work_.

- [Chapter 1](#chapter-i-kozmology) establishes _basic outline of the Spiral Knights' fictional Universe_, its cosmology, creation myth, and first alchemical narratives.
- Chapters 2-9 introduce main parties of the narrative while building upon the body of the theory through the discussion of themes found along those narratives:
  - [Chapter 2](#chapter-ii-establishment-of-undercorp) introduces _major actors within Underworld_.
  - [Chapter 3](#chapter-iii-ancient-titans) covers _creators of tortodrones_ found in <a href="https://wiki.spiralknights.com/March_of_the_Tortodrones" target="_blank">March of the Tortodrones</a>.
  - [Chapter 4](#chapter-iv-valkyries-of-heavenly-kingdom) makes introduction of the _heavenly kingdom and valkyries_.
  - [Chapter 5](#chapter-v-isorians) introduces _Spiral Order and Isorians_ into the story.
  - [Chapter 6](#chapter-vi-arrival-of-undercorp) covers effects of _Underworld's influence onto Cradle_ in the context of a previously covered [civilization behind tortodrones](#chapter-iii-ancient-titans).
  - [Chapter 7](#chapter-vii-kingdom-of-almire) covers a period of time embodied by the _kingdom of Almire_.
  - [Chapter 8](#chapter-viii-kat-tribe) cover _Owlites and the Kat Tribe_, their relation and history, connecting them to valkyries of [chapter 4](#chapter-iv-valkyries-of-heavenly-kingdom).
- [Intermission](#intermission-analysis-of-curse) makes the final analysis of the <a href="https://wiki.spiralknights.com/Curse" target="_blank">Curse</a>, its effects, metaphysical laws, themes, and inspirations, focusing on its relevance in the story beyond gameplay mechanics.
  - [Chapter 9](#chapter-ix-gremlin-empire) covers _gremlins and Clockworks_, _presence of slime family of monsters_, and the entirety of **Core and Swarm relation** backed by all of previously found motifs and themes.
- [Chapter 10](#chapter-x-spiral-knights) is the _final summarization of the timeline_, which throughout the summary refers to all of previously established concepts, conclusions, and connections in a condensed manner.

### Document structure

To avoid unrelated and unnecessary information tangents, mainly perpetuated by item descriptions, dialogues, alchemy paths, references onto them will be spread across the document and mentioned multiple times in the context of a discussed topic, so that they could be invoked without breaking away from the flow.

Although general description of the timeline will remain linear, some topics and overarching themes will be referencing to the future articles, those are usually capable of existing without prior established thought framework, unless it is stated otherwise.

<center class="chapter-break">
  <span class="energy">🜔</span>
</center>

<h3 align="center">Chapter <code>I</code>: Kozmology</h3>

At first, we will establish rough outline of the cosmology based on rank missions' briefings, dialogue, item, and equipment descriptions. We are not currently concerned with exact in-universe laws, under which each location operates, but with their themes.

While we believe both in-Universe physical laws and symbolic themes are important for the color-coded setting, with no knowledge of the prior, we can rely only on discovered patterns within the stories, and from them assume existence of those laws. Then, we will attempt to find symbolic element to them and cross-reference with mythology and folklore, as stories found there across multitude of cultures will serve us as a scaffolding and approximate guidelines for our theory on what we judge to be fitting thematically from a storytelling perspective while pointing out similarities, which could or could not be a source of inspiration. As for the themes emerging here from the relations between its' elements, they, we believe, as parts of the story, should also be internally consistent.

Those steps, we believe, would allow us to reverse engineer and understand an internally consistent physical foundation for the story to unfold.

#### Material Realm

As it is the main location of the setting within which most of game's events take place, we need to label it and distinguish from the other dimensions, locations, or realms, so, such name would suffice. The name we propose is to be one found in the contrast to a different realm, taken from the description of <a href="https://wiki.spiralknights.com/Weight_of_Darkness" target="_blank">Weight of Darkness</a>: `Why spirits return to the material realm is unknown` - material realm.

Material realm is home for wolvers, lichens, and rest of creatures, who are classified as neither fiends nor undead. It is the realm where Cradle would be located.

#### Underworld

Underworld, as it is referred as such in the mission <a href="https://wiki.spiralknights.com/Weight_of_Darkness" target="_blank">Weight of Darkness</a>: `It is speculated that all fiends within the Clockworks crossed over from a dimension known as the Underworld`, is the homeworld for the most of fiendish wildlife, such as <a href="https://wiki.spiralknights.com/Greaver" target="_blank">greavers</a> and <a href="https://wiki.spiralknights.com/Gorgo" target="_blank">gorgos</a>. Fiendish nature and ecosystem are isolated to the Underworld and effects of its presence on material realm will be closely observed throughout the timeline.

Underworld is also the homeworld for <a href="https://wiki.spiralknights.com/Devilite" target="_blank">devilites</a>, who are considered the workforce of the Underworld, as specified by the information module of <a href="https://wiki.spiralknights.com/Devilish_Drudgery" target="_blank">Devilish Drudgery</a>: `The office minions of the Underworld are a disgruntled lot, attacking any unauthorized personnel on sight. While not terrible threats on their own, they can become far worse if one of their Pit Bosses gets a hold of them`. Based on mission's name and description of <a href="https://wiki.spiralknights.com/White_collar_captives" target="_blank">White Collar Captives</a> devilites are considered by the Spiral Order as the office workers, - "white collars". That it is, if missions' descriptions are diegetic, written by Spiral Order, which we assume to be true.

Here we also acquire one of clues on the relation between Spiral Order and devilites:

- `A fiendish city is a strange place that Spiral HQ still does not fully understand.` (<a href="https://wiki.spiralknights.com/White_collar_captives" target="_blank">White Collar Captives</a>).
- `It is speculated that all fiends within the Clockworks crossed over from a dimension known as the Underworld` (<a href="https://wiki.spiralknights.com/Weight_of_Darkness" target="_blank">Weight of Darkness</a>).

Those instances of referring to Underworld and devilites, we may suggest, frame Spiral Order as ones who did not have an earlier opportunity to study devilites prior to Skylark crash landing on Cradle, meaning that Underworld had remained undiscovered by the Spiral Order. It could also be a case of Spiral Order being vaguely aware of the Underworld, but the significant progress in its understanding was made only on Cradle.

#### Apocrean Realm

Apocrean Realm has a relation to the Underworld through the presence of shadow damage, Undead, and presence of Lost Souls, as seen by the events of the <a href="https://wiki.spiralknights.com/Shroud_of_the_Apocrea" target="_blank">Shroud of Apocrea</a>, specifically, the <a href="https://wiki.spiralknights.com/Shroud_of_the_Apocrea/The_Grasping_Plateau" target="_blank">Grasping Plateau</a>, as it contains <a href="https://wiki.spiralknights.com/Soul#Freed_Soul" target="_blank">Freed Souls</a>, Undead, and devilites. The <a href="https://wiki.spiralknights.com/Shroud_of_the_Apocrea/The_Obsidian_Nexus" target="_blank">Obsidian Nexus</a> in that regard has direct presence of <a href="https://wiki.spiralknights.com/Soul" target="_blank">Lost Souls</a>.

Shadow damage is described by [Hahn, Spiral Order biotech](https://wiki.spiralknights.com/Hahn) as follows: `Shadow damage is generally caused by concentrations of negative energy. Attacks that inflict shadow damage include anything from the psychic manipulation of the aforementioned negative energy to physical attacks using weapons forged from dark matter` (<a href="https://wiki.spiralknights.com/Hahn#Dialogue" target="_blank">The Shadow Knows - Hahn</a>).

A more vague connection, which will be an ongoing theme, is the usage of the same words or patterns to characterize related items. For example, <a href="https://wiki.spiralknights.com/Obsidian_Shard" target="_blank">Obsidian Shard</a> is described to be `jet-black`, same as <a href="https://wiki.spiralknights.com/Trojan_Horseshoe" target="_blank">Trojan Horseshoe</a>. Trojans are said to belong to the legion of Ur, which is sealed within the Underworld (`the memo indicated that the Legion of Ur was sealed away in the Underworld` - <a href="https://wiki.spiralknights.com/The_Return_of_Ur" target="_blank">Legion of Ur</a>). Weather trojans are native to the Underworld will be explored in the [Legion of Ur section](#legion-of-ur).

##### Introduction of Souls

Here we should focus on Souls, as they are present across many separated location of Cradle, including Apocrean realm, Graveyards, and the Core:

- `The intel we've collected so far suggests that fiends utilize large deposits of the stuff to trap the souls of the lost within it, like some kind of icy prison. It would seem that Maulos, that horrible arch-fiend you just took down, had a different use in mind and was actually destroying this everfrost to unleash ... souls into the Clockworks` (<a href="https://wiki.spiralknights.com/Heart_of_Ice/Everfrost_Tower" target="_blank">Heart of Ice - Everfrost Tower - Recon Ranger</a>).
- `A 'towering pillar' of everfrost and 'all the frozen souls it brings forth'` - <a href="https://wiki.spiralknights.com/Heart_of_Ice/Amu-Sol" target="_blank">Heart of Ice - Amu-Sol - Fiendish Memo</a>
- `Only souls keep these engines roaring, heard screaming across distant stars. Only souls can fill their void, sublime in its vast emptiness` ([The Shroud of Apocrea - Patch Notes: 2013.10.23](https://forums.spiralknights.com/en/node/91276)).

Souls, ones that were suggested to be trapped in everfrost, which makes up Everfrost Pillar delivered from Underworld, we believe to be the same as the Lost Souls, or rather, <a href="https://wiki.spiralknights.com/Soul#Frozen_Soul" target="_blank">Frost Soul</a> variation encountered during the events of the <a href="https://wiki.spiralknights.com/Heart_of_Ice" target="_blank">Heart of Ice mission</a>. Those souls may potentially be ones referred to as spirits, with the general inclusion of the undead: `Why spirits return to the material realm is unknown` (<a href="https://wiki.spiralknights.com/Weight_of_Darkness" target="_blank">Weight of Darkness</a>).

All of those descriptions as well as presence of lost souls in the <a href="https://wiki.spiralknights.com/The_Obsidian_Nexus" target="_blank">Obsidian Nexus</a> suggests that Apocrean Realm and Underworld are connected, although nature of that connection is unknown at that point in the analysis.

#### Blinding Abyss

Blinding Abyss is one of a few realms described the least. It is a location closely related to frost. its name is taken from <a href="https://wiki.spiralknights.com/Heart_of_Ice/Amu-Sol" target="_blank">Fiendish Memo of Amu-Sol</a> - (`Blinding Abyss` - <a href="https://wiki.spiralknights.com/Heart_of_Ice/Amu-Sol" target="_blank">Fiendish Memo</a>). Despite being present only within a context of <a href="https://wiki.spiralknights.com/Heart_of_Ice/Amu-Sol" target="_blank">Heart of Ice</a>, it has multiple Underworld entities tied with it, namely devilites and <a href="https://wiki.spiralknights.com/Maulos#Maulos" target="_blank">Maulos</a>.

Judging by same reference to Maulos and his implied shadow-damaging powers of the Eternal Frost (`It is our understanding that all Pit Boss duties, administrative and otherwise, have been turned over to a 'Maulos of the Eternal Frost,', is that correct?` - <a href="https://wiki.spiralknights.com/Amu-Sol" target="_blank">Heart of Ice - Amu-Sol - Fiendish Memo</a>), while being a trojan, it is plausible for him to be an entity from the Underworld, yet far more powerful, reminiscent of <a href="https://wiki.spiralknights.com/Lord_Vanaduke" target="_blank">Lord Vanaduke</a>, mainly by both of them being fiends and of a unique kind. History behind Maulos will be examined throughout the analysis, as well as in the [analysis of Underworld influences](#influences-of-underworld), but currently, in the context of overall cosmology, it will be enough, as presence and abilities of Maulos relate to freezing theme of the Blinding Abyss.

#### Nameless Realm

Nameless Realm is mentioned in the description of the <a href="https://wiki.spiralknights.com/Chaos_Cloak" target="_blank">Chaos Cloak</a>: `A forbidden mantle said to grant the wearer protection within the nameless realm where all elements are said to converge into one and divide into all` (<a href="https://wiki.spiralknights.com/Chaos_Cloak" target="_blank">Chaos Cloak</a>).

At that very point the implied duality of the phrase above must be kept in mind, as this is the first instance a theme of alchemy presented within Spiral Knights' cosmology. Precisely, the concept of the Nameless Realm is one reminiscent of alchemical First Matter:

<BookCitation source="Psychology and Alchemy - Carl Jung">

`The “treasure hard to attain,” whose presence was suspected in the dark prima materia, is symbolized by the alchemists in various ways. Christopher of Paris, for instance, says that the chaos (as prima materia) is the work of all-wise nature. Our understanding ... , aided by the “celestial and glowing spirit,” must transform this natural work of art —chaos—into the celestial nature of the quintessence, and into the life- giving (vegetabilis) essence of heaven. The precious substance is potentially contained in this chaos as a massa confusa of all the elements rolled into one, and man must diligently apply his mind to it so that “our heaven” may come into reality (ad actum).`

---

`the earth (as prima materia) is not a dead body, but is inhabited by a spirit that is its life and soul. All created things, minerals included, draw their strength from the earth- spirit. This spirit is life, it is nourished by the stars, and it gives nourishment to all the living things ... This invisible spirit is like the reflection in a mirror, intangible, yet it is at the same time the root of all the substances necessary to the alchemical process or arising therefrom (radix nostrorum corporum).`

</BookCitation>

#### The Void: Part 1

The Void is mentioned only 2 times:

- The names of <a href="https://wiki.spiralknights.com/Swarm" target="_blank">Swarm-related entities</a> - when auto-target is enabled they are described as Void enemies, including the <a href="https://wiki.spiralknights.com/Void_Soul" target="_blank">Void Souls</a> during the events of <a href="https://wiki.spiralknights.com/Dreams_and_Nightmares" target="_blank">Dreams and Nightmares</a>.
- By <a href="https://wiki.spiralknights.com/Echo_Stone#Echo_Stone" target="_blank">a speaker in the Echo Stone of Gloaming Wildwoods</a>: `WITHIN MY DREAM I SAW IT OPEN THE VOID, FELT ITS ENDLESS HUNGER`

The void is currently a metaphysical concept with an unknown placement and role in the cosmology. At that point, the latter example could be a metaphor.

##### Swarm

The Swarm and the Void are connected by the supposedly ongoing narrative of the Echo Stones:

- `WITHIN MY DREAM I SAW IT OPEN THE VOID, FELT ITS ENDLESS HUNGER. ... WITHIN THIS DREAM, ITS MANY EYES CANNOT SEE YOU NOR CAN ITS MANY ARMS REACH YOU. ... USE WHAT IS HERE TO PREPARE FOR THE BATTLE TO COME. IT KNOWS OF YOU NOW. IT WILL FIND A WAY OUT AND COME FOR YOU` ([Echo Stone: Gloaming Wildwoods](https://wiki.spiralknights.com/Echo_stones#Echo_Stone)).
- `AS I DREAMED, IT CONSUMED. IT DEVOURED THE KNOWLEDGE OF TIME... MEMORIES OF THE DEAD... THE HEARTS OF KINGS AND THE SOULS OF THEIR PEOPLE... GOOD AND EVIL... IT CONSUMED. IT GREW STRONGER, ENDLESSLY MIRRORING ITSELF WITHIN THE SPACE OF MY DREAM. ENDLESSLY MIRRORING... EXPANDING... INFINITE. WHAT IT WAS BEFORE IT IS NO MORE. NEITHER BEAST NOR GOD, IT IS A CREATION UNLIKE ALL. IT IS... THE SWARM` ([Echo Stone: Firestorm Citadel](https://wiki.spiralknights.com/Echo_stones#Echo_Stone)).

Swarm, in a state, which it is discovered in, we believe could only be understood and categorized through development and application of a conceptual framework suggested by the [Rebis theory](#rebis-theory). It will be explored in detail in the [Gremlin Empire section](#chapter-ix-gremlin-empire) and applied in the [later Swarm section](#the-swarm), but now it must be kept in mind, that some, currently unknown, link can exist between the concept of void and Swarm due to identification of, at least, enemies.

This inevitably suggests that the interface of the game is diegetic - it is what Spiral Knight approximately sees through his default animation of any opened menu. So his targeting of enemies shows him their names, monster family and health. As for the monster families - we come from an idea, that that classification is developed by the Spiral Order biotechs, as they, like <a href="https://wiki.spiralknights.com/Hahn" target="_blank">Hahn</a>, disclose it through <a href="https://wiki.spiralknights.com/Hahn#Dialogue" target="_blank">monster families and damage type introductions</a>.

As for the void itself, - it will remain unclassified in our description of cosmology until further leads could be found.

#### Energy

There exists power, contained within <a href="https://wiki.spiralknights.com/Spark_of_life#Spark_of_Life" target="_blank">Sparks of Life</a>, capable of reviving recently deceased Knights. Sparks of Life become available on knight's second perishing, and differ from an initial emergency revive by giving temporary increase to Knight's damage output with a faster revival process, accompanied by a rumble across Clockworks, as seen by specs of dust falling as the knight revives.

It can be argued that emergency revive, at its base, is not the Spark of Life itself, but a related mechanism, as one provided by the equipment and capable of being recharged when passing through the depths. As stated, `All knights now have an Emergency Revive mechanism built into their armor that will revive them shortly after falling in combat once per floor. An ER only restores all the red health pips you have, but no more` ([Release Notes: 2013.07.30](https://wiki.spiralknights.com/Release_Notes_2013-07-30)). It must be kept in mind that emergency revive mechanic and Sparks of Life were introduced later in tandem with unification of mist and crystal energy (`Mist energy and mist tank items have been removed. Player-owned mist tanks have been replaced with 10 Sparks of Life (bound). Player-owned mini mist tanks have been replaced with 1 Spark of Life (bound) ‘Crystal Energy’ is now simply called ‘Energy’. Mist Wells have been renamed 'Energy Wells' and no longer provide a 25% bonus on deposit. Mist within Mist Wells has been converted to energy and may be withdrawn at 100 energy per day` - [Release Notes: 2013.07.30](https://wiki.spiralknights.com/Release_Notes_2013-07-30)).

Spark of Life represent a type of universal energy which is characterized by the light-blue rectangular pattern and will be referred as such in the analysis. That same energy is observed at Clockworks elevators on their usage. This behavior is also left from the earlier period of energy mechanics, when elevators had required energy to operate and transition depths, but the fact itself of energy used to power them - visually, - remains, and will be kept in mind as an important component to how Clockworks operate as an artificial construct. (`Elevators no longer require any energy to operate. Explore the Clockworks as much and as often as you wish!` - [Release Notes: 2013.07.30](https://wiki.spiralknights.com/Release_Notes_2013-07-30)).

Apart from this, there are other manifestation of energy, which affect living and non-living matter:

- Minerals are capable of internal depletion (`No more depleted Crimsonite here` - <a href="https://wiki.spiralknights.com/Deadly_Shard_Bomb" target="_blank">Deadly Shard Bomb</a>).
- There are <a href="https://wiki.spiralknights.com/Trojan" target="_blank">fuming trojans of tier 3</a> and <a href="https://wiki.spiralknights.com/Arkus" target="_blank">Arkus's burning shard after the first revive</a>. Those are supposedly dark matter crystal, which burn with pink flames. They will be later explored in greatest detail in [Legion of Ur section](#legion-of-ur). Those minerals were connected to the activity of Clockworks, notably, <a href="https://wiki.spiralknights.com/Gate_construction" target="_blank">gate construction</a>, which is later explored in the [tortodrones section](#anatomy-of-tortodrone-and-crimsonite) and [Minerals and Souls relation section](#minerals-and-souls-part-1).
- Existence of <a href="https://wiki.spiralknights.com/The_Artifact" target="_blank">the Artifact</a>, which is connected to the Core through the Mysterious consoles, can power Spiral Order field facilities as seen during the events of <a href="https://wiki.spiralknights.com/The_Ancient_Generator" target="_blank">The Ancient Generator</a>: `If you can restore power to the camp, the Spiral Knights can power their turrets and create a defensive perimeter. Once secure, it may be possible to reconnect with Spiral HQ`

  By extension, if Artifact's energy is compatible enough with Spiral Order technology, and we assume is the Core's energy, which is also desired by the Spiral Order. The latter, in fact, is the main premise and goal of Spiral Knights for descending into Clockworks: `The Core of the Clockworks could very well contain the energy source we need to create a new power source for the Skylark and restore it to operational condition` (<a href="https://wiki.spiralknights.com/Reporting_for_Duty#Dialogue" target="_blank">Reporting for Duty - Feron</a>). The Artifact is also known to be charged by gremlin technology:

  - `Work away from the others. The Order must never know we have the artifact. Find a way to power it. Bring it to me. Do not betray me. I will know` (<a href="https://wiki.spiralknights.com/Crossing_the_Chasm/The_Journey_to_Haven" target="_blank">Crossing the Chasm - The Journey to Haven - Herex</a>). We should note, based on general motivation of Herex, his name, and lack of any other candidates, all information modules signed as "-H" are written by Herex. The energy facility of <a href="https://wiki.spiralknights.com/The_Ancient_Generator/Restoring_Power" target="_blank">Restoring the Power</a> has all the same gremlin technology, the wires that lead up the platform with <a href="https://wiki.spiralknights.com/The_Artifact" target="_blank">the generator/Artifact</a>.
  - `I have already collected the power I need to use the Artifact and nothing you can do now will stop what I have set in motion` (<a href="https://wiki.spiralknights.com/Shadowplay/Throne_Room" target="_blank">Shadowplay - throne Room - Herex</a>),

- Tearium, the fuel of the main Skylark generator, or likely, reactor, is measured in tons: `After the Skylark crashed, its primary tearium core exploded, destroying a portion of the ship and leaving it without a main power source. Since so far we haven't found several hundred tons of tearium just lying around, the bird has effectively lost its wings` (<a href="https://wiki.spiralknights.com/Reporting_for_Duty#Dialogue" target="_blank">Reporting for Duty - Feron</a>). As Skylark secondary generator is barely enough to power the Lab (`We managed to pull the secondary generator from the Skylark mostly intact. Unfortunately its barely powerful enough to keep this lab running, let alone power our ship. We'll need to find another power source if we ever hope to return home` - [Haven - Lab - Biotech]()), we can establish a vague understanding of technological level of the Spiral Order.
- Found across Clockworks <a href="https://wiki.spiralknights.com/Fire_crystal#Fire_Crystal" target="_blank">Fire Crystals</a>, and specifically, radiant fire crystals, do contain a form of energy and heat. (`The heat within is wild and mysterious, shining brighter than any natural fire` - <a href="https://wiki.spiralknights.com/Fire_crystal#Radiant_Fire_Crystal" target="_blank">Radiant Fire Crystal</a>).

Then there is the phenomenon of transformed battle sprites seen during the rescue missions of <a href="https://wiki.spiralknights.com/A_Revelation_in_Flames" target="_blank">A Revelation in Flames</a>, <a href="https://wiki.spiralknights.com/Angels_from_Antiquity" target="_blank">Angels from Antiquity</a>, and <a href="https://wiki.spiralknights.com/The_Phantom_Mask" target="_blank">The Phantom Mask</a>, involving <a href="https://wiki.spiralknights.com/Drakon" target="_blank">Drakon</a>, <a href="https://wiki.spiralknights.com/Seraphynx" target="_blank">Seraphynx</a>, and <a href="https://wiki.spiralknights.com/Maskeraith" target="_blank">Maskeraith</a> battle sprites. This is not a regular behavior within known by the Spiral Order physics, as suggested by Rhedon: `The energy signature I'm detecting is erratic, but still definitely a battle sprite. They may be in trouble, so let's hurry! ... Something has happened to them, they've changed into some kind of creature. ... They seem friendly. In fact they seem to behave just like the battle sprites I know` (<a href="https://wiki.spiralknights.com/A_Revelation_in_Flames/Sunset_Steppes" target="_blank">Sunset Steppes - Rhedon</a>). Morlin suggests: `Though their cellular identity is still wholly that of a battle sprite. My hypothesis is that somehow they rapidly evolved to survive in their new environment` (<a href="https://wiki.spiralknights.com/A_Revelation_in_Flames/The_Lab" target="_blank">A Revelation in Flames/The Lab - Morlin</a>).

A speculation, which wil will develop further into a theory, is that the mention of the erratic energy signatures related to the description of energy of the Core, namely: `we discovered that within the heart of this rock resonates a power signature of unprecedented magnitude` (<a href="https://wiki.spiralknights.com/Reporting_for_Duty#Dialogue" target="_blank">Reporting for Duty - Feron</a>), as there is currently no other source of such transformation taking place across Clockworks.

Weather those mentioned earlier categories of energy could be traced back to a universal medium, one potentially represented by the designs of the Whitespace within the Core, remains a open question.

##### Spiral Order, Energy, and introduction to Alchemy

Based on [Kora's dialogue](https://wiki.spiralknights.com/Welcome_to_Haven!#Dialogue): `Lastly I need to get you up to speed on something called 'energy.' its very important to your mission here on Cradle`, it can be argued that the concept of energy might be unique to Cradle, but based on presence of energy symbol across Spiral Order equipment, such as turrets and handguns, it might be rather that the low ranking members of Spiral Order simply don't have access or the information about the energy. That could be a plausible solution, considering Spiral Order is a military organization, and, by extensions, Isorians, as they are in a state of existential war with Morai. And then they managed to exist for a long period of time, as evident by the celestial costume set: `This suit was once worn by Isorian starfarers of eons long passed that stood watch over extrasolar operations` (<a href="https://wiki.spiralknights.com/Stellar_Sentinel_Suit" target="_blank">Stellar Sentinel Suit</a>).

Noting here, Energy is also seemingly utilized by knights in 2 more areas:

- Powering dormant constructs and turrets through transfer of energy.
- Skylark's secondary reactor, one located in the Haven's Lab has same light-blue glow to it. Construction of the reactor and the Arcade gate pillars is practically the same, although this could be a case of asset optimization taken game's scope. For now, we consider the latter being th explanation.

The symbol of energy used by the Spiral Order has 2 elements to it, in detail observed in 3 instances:

- <a href="https://wiki.spiralknights.com/Energy_Well" target="_blank">Energy well</a> in Guild Hall has all attributes of energy, the glow, the patterns, and the symbol. What is important is the state of a well, when it contains no energy: the symbol of energy is rotated so that its middle horizontal line becomes vertical, and the symbol itself changes color to darker red.
- The knight's energy counter, when it reaches 0, becomes dark red.
- The <a href="https://wiki.spiralknights.com/Mecha_Turret#Auto_Turret" target="_blank">auto turrets</a> of Spiral Order, when they are deactivated, have the same, rotated vertically and red energy symbol.

We will refer to this variation of energy symbol as inverted for the consistency of our terminology.

Here, we would prose a potential link of energy - as a universal or close to one, medium, - and Spiral Order to alchemy, based on the <a href="https://wiki.spiralknights.com/Alchemy_for_Beginners" target="_blank">Alchemy for Beginners</a> mission description and dialogue: `Alchemy is a craft mastered by the Spiral Knights that allows for the inherent powers of various materials to awaken and fuse with each other in order to form powerful, new items! The Spiral Order has relied on alchemy as their primary means of creating the very arsenals that Knights have relied upon for centuries. ... That's because every time you transmute an item through alchemy, there is a chance you can get one of several Unique Variants that makes your item much more powerful!` (<a href="https://wiki.spiralknights.com/Alchemy_for_Beginners#Dialogue" target="_blank">Alchemy for Beginners - Bosco</a>).

We will consider this in-universe concept of alchemy as one inspired by the real-world many western and eastern interpretations of alchemy, while preserving the core concepts and modernized in the sci-fi setting. The existence of many conflicting interpretations of alchemy is its known property, attributed to its early origin.

<BookCitation source="Psychology and Alchemy - Carl Jung">

`Alchemy, as is well known, describes a process of chemical transformation and gives numberless directions for its accomplishment. Although hardly two authors are of the same opinion regarding the exact course of the process and the sequence of its stages, the majority are agreed on the principal points at issue, and have been so from the earliest times, i.e., since the beginning of the Christian era.`

`The alchemical opus deals in the main not just with chemical experiments as such, but with something resembling psychic processes expressed in pseudochemical language. The ancients knew more or less what chemical processes were; therefore they must have known that the thing they practised was, to say the least of it, no ordinary chemistry.`

`If the alchemist is admittedly using the chemical process only symbolically, then why does he work in a laboratory with crucibles and alembics? And if, as he constantly asserts, he is describing chemical processes, why distort them past recognition with his mythological symbolisms?`

`This puzzle has proved something of a headache to many an honest and well-meaning student of alchemy. On the one hand the alchemist declares that he is concealing the truth intentionally, so as to prevent wicked or stupid people from gaining possession of the gold and thus precipitating a catastrophe. But, on the other hand, the same author will assure us that the gold he is seeking is not—as the stupid suppose—the ordinary gold (aurum vulgi), it is the philosophical gold or even the marvellous stone, the lapis invisibilitatis (the stone of invisibility), or the lapis aethereus (the ethereal stone), or finally the unimaginable hermaphroditic rebis, and he will end up by saying that all recipes whatsoever are to be despised.`

---

`For psychological reasons, however, it is highly unlikely that the motive prompting the alchemist to secrecy and mystification was consideration for mankind. Whenever anything real is discovered it is usually announced with a flourish of trumpets. The fact is that the alchemists had little or nothing to divulge in the way of chemistry, least of all the secret of goldmaking.`

---

`The real nature of matter was unknown to the alchemist: he knew it only in hints. In seeking to explore it he projected the unconscious into the darkness of matter in order to illuminate it. In order to explain the mystery of matter he projected yet another mystery— his own unknown psychic background—into what was to be explained: Obscurum per obscurius, ignotum per ignotius! This procedure was not, of course, intentional; it was an involuntary occurrence.`

</BookCitation>

This introduces a notion of Spiral Order alchemy being a studied and predictable phenomenon, a complete inverse of its real-world counterpart. With this, considering that, initially, transmutation of gear had required energy, and then Orbs of Alchemy, we can make a guess that, as Spiral Order was familiar to alchemy, so energy was not a foreign concept to them.

#### Whitespace

Meanwhile, as its is implied that the Core itself is the energy source, a guess could be made, that it is the space within the Core, either Whitespace itself or some other location hidden within the Core is the real source of energy, from which energy is supplied and then distributed across Clockworks through the boundary of the Core. Here we will not discuss the Sleeper yet.

The fact that the knights contribute energy to an elevator in its required amount, while Spiral Order is not native to Cradle, makes energy seem as more of a cosmological constant. It means that Spiral Order and gremlin technology, such as <a href="https://wiki.spiralknights.com/Mecha_Knight#Mecha_Knight_Kit" target="_blank">mecha knights</a> and in lesser manner elevators, would not operate on the same if not more advanced resource belonging to Spiral Order as well as allow for knights to power dormant constructs around Clockworks. This creates a precedent, that energy is neither strictly gremlin nor Spiral Order civilizations' invention, but a universal property, to which both parties can tap into though their respective technology. And if it is a universal property, Whitespace could also be of similar nature, if not its more unknown form, given that it is within the Core to be held, or protected or contained in, in a similar manner to <a href="https://wiki.spiralknights.com/Energy_Well" target="_blank">Energy Wells</a>.

Despite earlier separation on Crystal and Mist Energy, and later emergence of unified measure of Energy in-game, it currently is unimportant to overall cosmology, apart from mention of crystals in crystal energy, linked to minerals and older concept of <a href="https://wiki.spiralknights.com/Gate_construction" target="_blank">Gate Construction</a> through deposition of Minerals.

Yet, this implication will be kept in mind as part of a worldbuilding framework, under which physical laws of Spiral Knights Universe operate.

Usually Whitespace is discussed in relation to the Swarm, Core and Cradle's past, and here we will do the same - as Swarm requires far greater and deeper analysis outside of current overview of preestablished concepts. Moreover the most of this analysis up to the end of chapter 9 serves as the preparation to this later analysis.

#### Dragons

The [material realm](#material-realm), and possibly, other realms, were inhabited by Dragons:

- The <a href="https://wiki.spiralknights.com/Frenzy_Rider_Mantle#Frenzy_Rider_Mantle" target="_blank">Riders' Mantles</a> refer to 3 gods using their elements - storms, rage and frenzy, - to `carve worlds from stone`. That gear is also the first instance of using sigils, which are present on armors' ribbon, they are not seemingly fiendish.
- Multiple <a href="https://wiki.spiralknights.com/Frenzy_Dragon_Helm#Frenzy_Dragon_Helm" target="_blank">Dragon Helms</a> refer to beasts, implied to be dragons, based on the equipment name, of storm, rage, and frenzy elements. In passing of those beasts worlds were created, with exception of rage element, which came to be disastrous - `beast who some believe razed the world in its passing: its rage became magma rain, its breath a typhoon` (<a href="https://wiki.spiralknights.com/Raging_Dragon_Helm#Raging_Dragon_Helm" target="_blank">Raging Dragon Helm</a>) - a very specific choice to words, compared to other 2 descriptions:

  - `created the world in its passing: its fire the sun, its bones the mountains` (<a href="https://wiki.spiralknights.com/Storm_Dragon_Helm#Storm_Dragon_Helm" target="_blank">Storm Dragon Helm</a>).
  - `shaped the world in its passing: its frenzy started the mighty winds, its scales became the shadows` (<a href="https://wiki.spiralknights.com/Frenzy_Dragon_Helm#Frenzy_Dragon_Helm" target="_blank">Frenzy Dragon Helm</a>).

Can it be proven that these were in fact dragons and not a metaphor?

Battle sprite here are the key. We know that Spiral Order knew how dragons look like, based on Rhedon quote: `They seem friendly. In fact they seem to behave just like the battle sprites I know. Only difference is they, uh, well, look like dragons` (<a href="https://wiki.spiralknights.com/A_Revelation_in_Flames/Sunset_Steppes" target="_blank">A Revelation in Flames - Sunset Steppes - Rhedon</a>). Due to an unidentified relation between dragons and Spiral Order, but though the presence of dragon scales in Azure Guardian armor - `A noble helmet reserved for the most senior members of the Spiral Order. The technique which weaves dragon scale seamlessly into the metal is a closely guarded secret` (<a href="https://wiki.spiralknights.com/Azure_Guardian_Helm" target="_blank">Azure Guardian Helm</a>), the naming of Drakon here only affirms Spiral Order's view of them as reminiscent of dragons, which by proxy suggests a general appearance of the latter.

We propose, that 3 sub-specie of Drakons suggest existence of divine, shadow and rage dragons, which, if mapped onto earlier elements of storm, frenzy, and rage would plausibly fit to descriptions of implied dragon beasts, referred in the <a href="https://wiki.spiralknights.com/Frenzy_Dragon_Helm#Frenzy_Dragon_Helm" target="_blank">Dragon Helms</a>. This logic will be also studied for the existence of Seraphynx battle sprites, as, by a current proposal, they became reincarnations of Kat Tribe. The Kat Tribe will be covered in its own chapter.

We match 3 sub-species of Drakon battle sprites to 3 elements, established earlier. First, there are 3 variant of Drakon: regular <a href="https://wiki.spiralknights.com/Drakon" target="_blank">red Drakon</a>, [divine Drakon](<https://wiki.spiralknights.com/Drakon_(Divine)>) and [shadow Drakon](<https://wiki.spiralknights.com/Drakon_(Shadow)>) suggest existence of divine and shadow aspects to their evolution, if we acknowledge Morlin's explanation: `Though their cellular identity is still wholly that of a battle sprite. My hypothesis is that somehow they rapidly evolved to survive in their new environment` (<a href="https://wiki.spiralknights.com/A_Revelation_in_Flames/The_Lab" target="_blank">A Revelation in Flames/The Lab - Morlin</a>).

While [divine drakon](<https://wiki.spiralknights.com/Drakon_(Divine)>) can be attributed to an element of storms, and [shadow drakon](<https://wiki.spiralknights.com/Drakon_(Shadow)>) to frenzy, the regular Drakon relates to rage: `The Drakon is a battle sprite that embodies fiery destruction. Its skills focus on raw, offensive power` (<a href="https://wiki.spiralknights.com/Drakon" target="_blank">Drakon</a>), - which could be considered as closely related to a concept of rage. The prior 2 are unlikely to be obtained from the start, so the way Spiral Order refers to Drakon would be characteristic of a connection to rage.

Those naming conventions, their presence, in relation to dragons and drakon sprites we believe to be connected by being different interpretations of fundamental laws of the Universe, with antique convention resenting them as frenzy, rage and divinity, and modern naming convention, one passing through Spiral Order understanding, and characteristic of their properties. This results in a parity of shadow damage/frenzy, normal damage/rage, elemental damage/divinity. Together, they establish concepts of _divinity being same as elemental damage and storms_, the _shadow as frenzy_, and _rage as pure normal damage with a lack of an element, but characteristic ferocity_: `its frenzy started the mighty winds, its scales became the shadows` (<a href="https://wiki.spiralknights.com/Frenzy_Dragon_Helm#Frenzy_Dragon_Helm" target="_blank">Frenzy Dragon Helm</a>).

This description `its frenzy started the mighty winds, its scales became the shadows` (<a href="https://wiki.spiralknights.com/Frenzy_Dragon_Helm#Frenzy_Dragon_Helm" target="_blank">Frenzy Dragon Helm</a>) introduces scales, that are <a href="https://wiki.spiralknights.com/Dragon_Scale" target="_blank">Dragon Scales</a>, a material, for a fact belonging to a dragon. But now it is question of weather it belongs to shadow sub-specie of dragons, based on the fact it is mentioned for frenzy dragons, or those scales could belong to an entire specie of dragons, as they seemingly surpass elemental classification boundary, not ties to a specific nature.

Those scales could relate to Underworld or to general supernatural by the fact of usage of word `otherworldly`, as may be hinted by the description: `An armored scale from what was thought to be an extinct creature. It reflects light with an otherworldly sheen` (<a href="https://wiki.spiralknights.com/Dragon_Scale" target="_blank">Dragon Scale</a>). But, at the same time, items crafted from that material are not restricted to shadow-related damage and defense only, as well as existence of [Divine Drakons](<https://wiki.spiralknights.com/Drakon_(Divine)>) suggests a nature, thematically different from the Underworld, so the scales could belong to any sub-specie of dragons - which will be our current reasoning, while affirming their extra-natural status without aligning them to a concrete realm.

The rage/normal damage thematic parity is also seen in <a href="https://wiki.spiralknights.com/Tortodrone" target="_blank">tortodrones</a>: `handgun empowered by the limitless fury of a tortodrone. While wielding it you can feel the berserk energy within eager to be unleashed` (<a href="https://wiki.spiralknights.com/Grand_Tortofist" target="_blank">Grand Tortofist</a>), - and it deals pure normal damage. Tortodrones themselves are associated with rage not only by their equipment and design of cosmetics, but the design of an [enraged tortodrone](<https://wiki.spiralknights.com/March_of_the_Tortodrones_(Mission)>) of missions card.

While corrupted (`A handgun alchemized from the shell of a corrupted tortodrone.` - <a href="https://wiki.spiralknights.com/Grim_Buster" target="_blank">Grim Buster</a>) tortodrones are fought in <a href="https://wiki.spiralknights.com/March_of_the_Tortodrones/Call_of_the_Colossi" target="_blank">Call of the Colossi</a>. The colossi in question, due to tortodrones' size, we suggest, are those exact tortodrones. They still deal normal and elemental damage, despite their corrupted weaponry likely being <a href="https://wiki.spiralknights.com/Gorgofist" target="_blank">Gorgofist</a>, as it is a shadow-damaging weapon. So far, we will not delve into the specifics of Tortodrones, as they will be revisited later in the [Arrival of Undercorp section](#chapter-vi-arrival-of-undercorp), where this motif will be explored in greater depth.

As for the divine Drakon and its dragon counterpart, one more similarity can be suggested to parallel to the established idea dragons being interstellar species.

<BookCitation source="Psychology and Alchemy - Carl Jung">

`The dragon in itself is a monstrum - a symbol combining the chthonic principle of the serpent and the aerial principle of the bird. It is, as Ruland says, a variant of Mercurius. But Mercurius is the divine winged Hermes manifest in matter, the god of revelation, lord of thought and sovereign psychopomp`

</BookCitation>

This renders dragons in alchemy as figures of dual nature of the Universe.

Due to this we propose that:

- Drakon battle sprites are reincarnations of dragons, both are categorized into sub-species associated with damage types of **storms/divinity/elemental damage**, **rage/normal damage**, and **frenzy/shadow damage**.
- Dragons exist across multiple realms or their habitat is not restricted to a singular celestial body, this feature will be revisited and dissected in relation to Spiral Order in the [Old Order Knights of Isora section](#establishment-of-order) - that Spiral Order is aware of dragons and had their own interactions with them, while it is Cradle of all places which has large amounts of draconic imagery and designs, specifically, castles. Those castles we believe are inherited from other civilization, which had their own experiences with dragons.

#### Creation Myth

At some point in time either Cradle or a planet which was later consumed by the Core as Cradle was built, had formed - it was not of dragons perishing, as described in <a href="https://wiki.spiralknights.com/Frenzy_Dragon_Helm#Frenzy_Dragon_Helm" target="_blank">Dragon Helms</a>, but rather the planet was inhabited by these dragons, whose power was so immense that it could reshape landscapes. Considering many another semi-magical instances of world being changed, such as spirits returning to material realm, Kataclysm, and general theming of those, we believe an aspect of truth can still be attributed to those descriptions:

- `visage of beast who some believe created the world in its passing: its fire the sun, its bones the mountains` (<a href="https://wiki.spiralknights.com/Storm_Dragon_Helm#Storm_Dragon_Helm" target="_blank">Storm Dragon Helm</a>)
- `visage of beast who some believe razed the world in its passing: its rage became magma rain, its breath a typhoon` (<a href="https://wiki.spiralknights.com/Raging_Dragon_Helm#Raging_Dragon_Helm" target="_blank">Raging Dragon Helm</a>)
- `visage of beast who some believe shaped the world in its passing: its frenzy started the mighty winds, its scales became the shadows` (<a href="https://wiki.spiralknights.com/Frenzy_Dragon_Helm#Frenzy_Dragon_Helm" target="_blank">Frenzy Dragon Helm</a>)

Dragons' lifespan is unknown, but as <a href="https://wiki.spiralknights.com/Dragon_Scale" target="_blank">dragon scales</a> are present and are capable of withstanding effects of time, while still be used in 5-star alchemy by the Spiral Order, has its own implications of dragons' lifespan, or at least longevity of their armor. At the same time, it is stated that dragons may not be extinct: `An armored scale from what was thought to be an extinct creature`.

As we do not have any other example of a world being created by such means, which would suggest it being a myth with consideration of plausibility of powers seen across the Clockworks, we can consider several interpretations of those:

- If dragons did create the worlds in their passing, this would seem as if their existence is not one of as generally understood lifecycle of species, existing in a different understanding of the word, - as a part of the process of Universe taking its form.

  Them being extinct after this would be interpreted as a myth of their disappearance - a creature powerful enough - so that it would not be present in a world born of their passing. Such interpretation would be similar to a popularized idea of an immortal Chinese dragon.

- If we consider dragons immortal and divine entities, and them being potentially alive to the present-day Cradle, implies that some external force would be present far in the past, that had caused dragons' extinction. This force should be powerful enough to defeat beasts implied to be wielding powers of storms, rage and frenzy, as suggested by riders' mantles.

  <a href="https://wiki.spiralknights.com/Rider_Mantle" target="_blank">Riders</a> in that regard could be either literal riders of dragons, or riders of the metaphorical forces. In this case, for now, the latter interpretation seems fitting, due to riders' status as gods, capable to `to carve whole worlds from stone` (<a href="https://wiki.spiralknights.com/Rider_Mantle" target="_blank">Rider Mantle</a>). In this interpretation, dragons are similar to their germanic, european understanding, wherein dragon is a both an physical obstacle and symbolic element of a story.

<h3 align="center">Chapter <code>II</code>: Establishment of Undercorp</h3>

Within Underworld fiendish ecosystem develops. Devilites emerge as one of conscious species, and over time develop a society, existing, as currently known, within corporations. One such corporation is named Undercorp and is related to material realm (`Assistant Supervisor of Resource Allocations, Undercorp` - <a href="https://wiki.spiralknights.com/Morgral%27m" target="_blank">Morgral'm</a>) through its presence in the <a href="https://wiki.spiralknights.com/March_of_the_Tortodrones/Ancient_Grove" target="_blank">Ancient Grove</a>.

Underworld is not devoid of elements. Based on fiendish biology and elemental alignment of devilites, subdivisions are formed within the corporate structure:

- Shock-themed devilites form Undercorp's IT department (<a href="https://wiki.spiralknights.com/Devilite#Devil-IT" target="_blank">Devil-IT</a>)
- Freeze-themed Layoafers <a href="https://wiki.spiralknights.com/Devilite#Layoafer" target="_blank">Layoafer</a>, they are later be trying to establish its own organization at Cradle, separate from Undercorp (<a href="https://wiki.spiralknights.com/Morgral'm" target="_blank">Fiendish Memo</a>) with Maulos, a trojan, summoned for unknown means
- <a href="https://wiki.spiralknights.com/Firebrander#Firebrander" target="_blank">Firebranders</a> do use magic in order to form fireballs. Their name suggest a branding with fire of others, alluding to form of branding with a hot iron. This symbolism in the context of a corporate setting may be alluded to those devilites being Undercorp security.

Most of overtimers have unique fiendish weaponry - pitchforks and axes, which have a peculiar property of being made of stone-like mineral with visible cracks in areas of connection. The color aligns with base elemental status effects found across Cradle, apart from curse.

The curse status is absent as well as its imagery. Weapons, which do not belong to any status effect have pink color and deal only normal damage. This will be kept in mind for the [intermediate analysis of the curse section](#intermission-analysis-of-curse).

Layoafers and Blarfuls in relation to the rest of corporate hierarchy do not seem to fit in it, rather being outside of it.

#### Dark Cities

Devilite society is developed enough for corporations to exist, and even considered that devilites were from a different intellectual property, they still remain weaved into Spiral Knights cosmology and setting.

It is suggested by Spiral Order, that devilites within dark cities are stranded on Cradle: `It is speculated that all fiends within the Clockworks crossed over from a dimension known as the Underworld. While how they crossed over and what their motives are on Cradle is unclear, data collected from fiendish cities seems to indicate that they are now stranded on Cradle, much like us ... Why spirits return to the material realm is unknown, trough it is clear that many of the spirits within the Clockworks have come from other worlds` (<a href="https://wiki.spiralknights.com/Weight_of_Darkness" target="_blank">Weight of Darkness</a>).

Devilites being stranded could mean both spacial and dimensional dislocation, as they had not, compared to Skylark, arrived to Cradle through interstellar travel, but rather summoned or captured with the cities themselves, if dark cities belong to them.

It is also unknown for now weather metaphysics of Cradle itself is the reason for spirits returning into material realm and devilites being stranded - both cases relating to cross-realm transition between material realm and likely Underworld. Moreover, devilites do continuous research to bring back legion of Ur, so the fact they had to use ritual circles as the last measure as suggested by [The Return of Ur]() mission's description `an alternative approach would be required for bringing them back`, implies that the original method is different, one we believe is of Grim Gates, as it is the only other known method of transportation related to devilite technology.

With a high certainty we gather that ritual circles are utilized to summon trojans from the Underworld, as implied by depths' names and their level design - <a href="https://wiki.spiralknights.com/Dark_City/Plazamonium" target="_blank">Plazamonium</a> is referred in the <a href="https://wiki.spiralknights.com/The_Return_of_Ur" target="_blank">The Return of Ur</a> as the `Summoning Circle`, followed by the [`Banishment`](https://wiki.spiralknights.com/The_Return_of_Ur#Gate_Map), relating to a popularized idea of entities being summoned from an abstract "beyond". Likely, in the case of the Spiral Knights setting, this location is established to be the Underworld.

If the cities were excavated and later integrated into Cradle, devilites by fact of crossing to material realm, should have the technology that would allow them to move back to Underworld, unless it is a one-way operation. The existence of such technology may be affirmed by presence of Grim Gates, which seem to lead to other dark cities.

Yet it is unknown weather those places - dark city's interior, depicted in active Grim Gates portals - are located on Cradle or in the Underworld, or if Grim Gates are so rare that devilites had to utilize regular summoning as in case of Legion of Ur, separate from the events of March of Tortodrones, when those gates are found. Moreover, it could be the case of Legion of Ur being "sealed" - which would potentially forbid Grim Gates from allowing them to pass through. We will analyze and identify those laws of transportation in detail, as for now we group them in order to perceive the general scale of Underworld's presence on Cradle.

Based on ideas of battle sprite relating to Cradle or pre-Cradle history, it can be possible for Core being involved in the process of tempering with realms within the space taken up by Cradle. It must be kept in mind as it is a highly anomalous behavior from Spiral Order point of view, at the same time suggesting that Spiral Order knows about existence of spirits to some degree.

In Heart of Ice, it is stated that city of Amu-Sol belongs to devilites, and has name similar to <a href="https://wiki.spiralknights.com/Fiendish_ID_Card#Recipe" target="_blank">fiendish glyphs</a>, ones used to power grim gates - of `Ur`, `Tor`, `Nok`, `Sol`, `Amu`. It is likely that the city itself is of Underworld origin given its name, and was not originally in that shattered state in which it is found, unless the names of the cities were given by devilites after they occupied them, which seems less plausible. For the most part, from the standpoint of corporate theme of devilites, those cities seem to be devilites' main habitat and we will assume them belonging to devilites, rather than any currently undisclosed civilization. This will be our current assumption.

Another city, Sol' Fork, has already established naming pattern: `After Recon Knights discovered a fiendish city known as Sol' Fork, Spiral HQ deployed a research team to station itself in the heart of the city and study the devilites within. Their finding have become the basis for our understanding of devilite culture and their motives for working with gremlins` (<a href="https://wiki.spiralknights.com/Whipping_and_Mishandling" target="_blank">Whipping and Mishandling</a>).

There was a successful operation of bringing both Maulos and everfrost pillar into Underworld, suggesting that some connection, maybe even to a small degree, remains on Cradle, as <a href="https://wiki.spiralknights.com/Morgral%27m" target="_blank">Morgral'm's communications</a> suggest. How grim gates operate in this context we will analyze closer in [later chapter](#arrival-of-undercorp).

At the same time, another proposal in creation to dark cities could be made - as Cradle is implied to collect and integrate other planets, had it integrated some dark cities from a devilite colony from a different planet? This can seem plausible, as it does not change our proposal of dark cities belonging to devilites, and their main base of operation - Undercorp - being located in the Underworld, with the Core functioning as a potential disruption to Undercorp operations, hindering transportation between the realms.

#### Influences of Underworld

The notion is of trojans being summoned by devilites, as described in <a href="https://wiki.spiralknights.com/The_Return_of_Ur" target="_blank">The Return of Ur</a>: `devilites are attempting to summon a legion of powerful trojan warriors. Based on intel from a devilite internal memo, the trojans are known as the 'Legion or Ur', and are said to have once numbered in the thousands. Strangely, the memo indicated that the Legion of Ur was sealed away in the Underworld and that an alternative approach would be required for bringing them back`, can be viewed in the context of Maulos, as, by the fact of him being a trojan, a chain of events had to transpire in order for Maulos to be created - a unique fiend with relation to everfrost, so far as it is imbued into him in place of the supposed dark matter shard of trojans.

Actions of Maulos and his supposed cult of devilites seem to be not approved by Undercorp:

- `The entirety of Amu-Sol is swarming with frozen souls and deep within the heart of the city lies the source of it all: the cult's powerful leader, Maulos and a towering column of pure everfrost.` ([Patch Notes: Heart of Ice](https://forums.spiralknights.com/en/node/61137))
- `You are receiving this mail as a result of an incorrect/cryptic entry in your recent resource allocation request` (<a href="https://wiki.spiralknights.com/Morgralm" target="_blank">Heart of Ice - Amu-Sol - Fiendish Memos (from Morgral'm)</a>)

The operation within the Amu-Sol seemingly went in a different direction, as it was not approved by Undercorp at least at that point in time, as not being related to devilites' attempts to bring back legion of Ur at least at that point in time and cult's progression.

While this idea of Maulos being potentially related to the general plot of Legion of Ur, we will return to them later in the detailed analysis of their nature. As for now, as we make introductory coverage of most Underworld-related entities, and organized at that, we have to point out thematic parallel which can be drawn between the general narratives of:

- Maulos, as a trojan, different from the rest of Legion of Ur
- Maulos's unnatural power of frost: `HR has requested an updated org chart as soon as possible. It is our understanding that all Pit Boss duties, administrative and otherwise, have been turned over to a 'Maulos of the Eternal Frost,'` (<a href="https://wiki.spiralknights.com/Amu-Sol" target="_blank">Heart of Ice - Amu-Sol - 'Fiendish Memo'</a>)
- Source of unnatural frost being related to <a href="https://wiki.spiralknights.com/Everfrost" target="_blank">everfrost</a>: `A small patch of ice crystals that never seem to melt, even when exposed to direct heat`.
- [Blinding Abyss](#blinding-abyss) as the implied location from which Maulos originates, metaphorical or literal
- <a href="https://wiki.spiralknights.com/Wolver#Perma-Frostifur" target="_blank">Perma-frostifurs</a> as deathless and fierce evolutions of <a href="https://wiki.spiralknights.com/Frostifur#Frostifur" target="_blank">frostifurs</a> and far more powerful than <a href="https://wiki.spiralknights.com/Frostifur#Alpha_Frostifur" target="_blank">Alpha-Frostifurs</a>, relating to themes of permafrost - a classification for a permanently frozen ground under cold climate.
- Trojans
- Underworld, as it is the source of the Everfrost Pillar: `You are receiving this mail as a result of an incorrect/cryptic entry in your recent resource allocation request. Please provide a detailed summary of your projected use of the following requested resources:
... A 'towering pillar' of everfrost and 'all the frozen souls it brings forth'` (<a href="https://wiki.spiralknights.com/Amu-Sol" target="_blank">Heart of Ice - Amu-Sol - 'Fiendish Memo'</a>) and is the only known entity to utilize everfrost for its soul-holding power: `The intel we've collected so far suggests that fiends utilize large deposits of the stuff to trap the souls of the lost within it, like some kind of icy prison. ... It would seem that Maulos, that horrible arch-fiend you just took down, had a different use in mind and was actually destroying this everfrost to unleash swarms of angry, frozen souls into the Clockworks.` (<a href="https://wiki.spiralknights.com/Everfrost_Tower" target="_blank">Heart of Ice - Everfrost Tower - Recon Ranger</a>).

And later established and explored themes found within:

- [Lord Vanaduke](#kingdom-of-almire) and his relation to curse.
- [Curse, Darkfire](#nature-of-darkfire) and [unnatural fires](#he-brought-fire-from-the-mountains) as manifestations of influence not from the material realm.
- <a href="https://wiki.spiralknights.com/Dark_Ember" target="_blank">Dark embers</a> as the only material related to the nature of the aforementioned fires as not native to material realm.
- Identity of <a href="https://wiki.spiralknights.com/Fang_of_Vog" target="_blank">Vog</a> as a entity related to concepts of transformation and fire.
- Absent <a href="https://wiki.spiralknights.com/Vog_Cub_Coat" target="_blank">Vog cubs implied by fiery wolver coat</a> and yet present <a href="https://wiki.spiralknights.com/Wolver#Ash_Tail" target="_blank">ash tail wolvers</a>.

The idea which we will explore is of the source of such influences being located in the Underworld, - influences such as `dark gods`: `One of many statuettes carried by fiends as a means of gaining favor with their dark gods` (<a href="https://wiki.spiralknights.com/Wicked_Idol" target="_blank">Wicked idol</a>), - not restricted to Vog specifically, rather than making him a most detailed to date example, but in greater scheme **marking Underworld as a major source of unnatural influence onto material realm**, as both Lord Vanaduke's and Maulos's powers have relation to shadow damage, that those powers indeed come from Underworld and deific entities there.

It is not confirmed weather all encountered on Cradle devilites work for Undercorp, but if Morgral'm's memos are to be considered in relation to Heart of Ice, March of Tortodrones and Grim Gates, it is rather likely that Undercorp is at the forefront of crossing into material realm and is the one to which Crimson Order outsources given tasks:

- `Analysis of the data collected from these offices indicates that devilite corporations are outsourced by gremlins in order to design and manage various projects that include weapons specifically engineered to target Spiral Knight squads` (<a href="https://wiki.spiralknights.com/Work_for_Idle_Hands" target="_blank">Work for Idle Hands</a>).
- `Their finding have become the basis for our understanding of devilite culture and their motives for working with gremlins` (<a href="https://wiki.spiralknights.com/Whipping_and_Mishandling" target="_blank">Whipping and Mishandling</a>).

#### Fiendish Cults

Through fiend costume sets it is implied that at least 1 tangible deity exist in the Underworld:

- `A mask said to have been worn by fanatics that worshiped a magma god. Its fires will light the path to victory` (<a href="https://wiki.spiralknights.com/Fiend_Mask" target="_blank">Magmatic Fanatic</a>).
- `A plated mail said to have been worn by fanatics that worshiped a magma god. Its fires will protect those that are worthy` (<a href="https://wiki.spiralknights.com/Magmatic_Fanatic_Mail#Magmatic_Fanatic_Mail" target="_blank">Magmatic Fanatic Mail</a>) - [Fire GOOD!](https://forums.spiralknights.com/en/node/111013): `burning things while taking on the visage of a fiery deity of martial prowess`
- <a href="https://wiki.spiralknights.com/Vog_Slippers#Vog_Slippers" target="_blank">Vog Slippers</a> may suggest that Vog is a fiendish entity similar in anatomy to a wolver, as it is grouped with slippers of different families of wolvers of <a href="https://wiki.spiralknights.com/Cozy_Prize_Box" target="_blank">Cozy Prize Box</a>, yet there is evidence of this depiction being a vog cub, rather than th e deity itself: `The great fire beast Vog. The great fire beast Vog isn't a wolver himself, but a fiery deity of sorts who embraces some creatures and grants them a bit of power. Vog's 'cubs' are more or less acquired and forced to spread his fiery love across the world` (<a href="https://forums.spiralknights.com/en/node/9995#comment-55776" target="_blank">Forums - Nick Popovich</a>).

Descriptions of magmatic fanatic armor and helm are very reminiscent of the becoming of Lord Vanaduke, latter explored during the [analysis of Lord Vanaduke](#he-brought-fire-from-the-mountains), and we will propose that it the same powerful entity referred in those cosmetics and analysis of Almire's downfall.

Then, there is a venom fiend:

- `A mask said to be crafted in the visage of a venomous fiend. It is infused with a vile essence that is sure to frighten your foes` (<a href="https://wiki.spiralknights.com/Fiend_Mask" target="_blank">Venom Fiend</a>).
- `A plated mail said to be crafted in the image of a venomous fiend. It comes with a sinister skin suit that pulses with a vile essence` (<a href="https://wiki.spiralknights.com/Venom_Fiend_Mail#Venom_Fiend_Mail" target="_blank">Venom Fiend Mail</a>).

As the design of the armor is closely similar to the Magmatic set, it is plausible to suggest that a fiend referred here is also a deity - we will label it as a Vile deity. To counter this suggestion, we may refer to the similarities of visual effects of celestial sets from <a href="https://wiki.spiralknights.com/Equinox_Prize_Box" target="_blank">Equinox Prize Box</a>.

To identify those possible deities, other sources must be looked at. Notably, only magmatic and arctic shackles are present across accessories (<a href="https://wiki.spiralknights.com/Magmatic_Shackles#Magmatic_Shackles" target="_blank">Shackles</a>), which, though a logical leap, can suggest that some power was responsible for their creation involving frost and magma - both of those elements being to an extent related to Underworld and powers which stem from Underworld's influence. The latter, arctic shackles are acquired from the <a href="https://wiki.spiralknights.com/Glacial_Prize_Box" target="_blank">Glacial Prize Box</a>, which is related both to eldrich identity of Apocrea, explored in the [arctic plot section](#nefarious-imp-arctic-plot).

The placement of those cultists and fanatics will be explored in their [relevant section](#discovery-of-vile-deity).

##### Graveyards

Relevant to the current context in tracking down influences and presence of Underworld are <a href="https://wiki.spiralknights.com/Graveyard" target="_blank">graveyards</a>.

Within graveyards there are a few distinct features:

- Some tombstones are cracked and have green essence flowing through the cracks in its surface.
- Green fires on crypt walls are unique to this location.
- Graveyards themselves are seem to be located not completely in the material realm, have a motif, later explored in the [Kat Tribe and Kataclysm section](#chapter-viii-kat-tribe): `Graveyards are an unnatural place, a world between worlds where lost souls gather, hungry for the life of any live soul that must pass through` ([Information Module: Graveyard](https://wiki.spiralknights.com/Information_Module:_Graveyard)). Our suggestion consists of those locations being in between material realm and Underworld, and are related to the state Cradle is found, connected with the phenomenon of spirits returning to material realm (`Why spirits return to the material realm is unknown, trough it is clear that many of the spirits within the Clockworks have come from other worlds.` - <a href="https://wiki.spiralknights.com/Weight_of_Darkness" target="_blank">Weight of Darkness</a>).

The green color motif may be attributed to several supernatural materials:

- `A bit of ectoplasm meticulously collected from an unwilling undead volunteer. its an unpleasant shade of green` (<a href="https://wiki.spiralknights.com/Ecto_Drop" target="_blank">Ecto Drop</a>)
- `A powerful essence left behind when a creature perishes from a particularly putrid disease` (<a href="https://wiki.spiralknights.com/Plague_Essence" target="_blank">Plague Essence</a>)

The argument behind plague essence, as its icon was chosen to be of a flame, will tie in with the curse and Vanaduke, specifically, <a href="https://wiki.spiralknights.com/Dark_Ember" target="_blank">Dark Ember</a> being, supposedly, the source of unnatural fires in a similar manner how everfrost is at the foundation of unnatural frost.

Currently, to avoid to much reference to unexplored topic of Almire, it can be safe to suggest, that the essence, that is present within gravestones is the ectoplasm, and, possibly, reason behind <a href="https://wiki.spiralknights.com/Zombie#Dust_Zombie" target="_blank">dust zombies</a> having green eyes.

<h3 align="center">Chapter <code>III</code>: Ancient Titans</h3>

From [dragons](#dragons), referred to as `creatures of legend` (`A mythical shield crafted from the scales of a creature of legend` - <a href="https://wiki.spiralknights.com/Dragon_Scale_Shield" target="_blank">Dragon Scale Shield</a>), their descendants were born: drakes and potentially wyverns (<a href="https://wiki.spiralknights.com/Wyvern_Scale_Shield" target="_blank">Wyvern Scale Shield</a>), explored later in its alchemy path:

- `A helmet crafted from the scales of beasts thought to be the descendants of dragons` (<a href="https://wiki.spiralknights.com/Drake_Scale_Helm" target="_blank">Drake Scale Helm</a>).
- `Armor forged from the scales of beasts thought to be descendants of dragons` (<a href="https://wiki.spiralknights.com/Drake_Scale_Mail" target="_blank">Drake Scale Mail</a>).

This establishes drakes as descendants of dragons. Here, an important distinction must be made of dragons as they are described in different cultures. Specifically, it is the differences of a _continental european dragon_ and a _celtic dragon_. It will be important in relation to a further discussed [valkyries of heavenly kingdom](#chapter-iv-valkyries-of-heavenly-kingdom), but before that - for understanding of wyverns and drakes as species.

Germanic and then northern depictions of dragons are _wingless and limbless serpents_, and european dragons are depicted as _winged creatures with 4 legs and a pair of wings_. Here a comparison with drakon battle sprites must be made. _Drakons - battle sprites, - possess front limbs and occasionally wings or large paws, depending on their evolution_. The consistent element is the jagged jaw and a pair of horns on the back of the head.

It can be argued that dragons' canon form had wings based on <a href="https://wiki.spiralknights.com/Dragon_Wings" target="_blank">dragon wings accessory</a>, although wings of explicitly storm, rage, and frenzy <a href="https://wiki.spiralknights.com/Wings_of_Rage#Wings_of_Rage" target="_blank">do differ</a>, resembling the prismatic, artificial counterpart, whose place of all seem to belong to <a href="https://wiki.spiralknights.com/Rider_Mantle" target="_blank">Rider Mantles</a> due to their thematic parity and slimmer build. Presence of wings as well as overall look of drakon battle sprites could suggest that the dragons in question were of european-inspired appearance, as well as recognizing dragons of frenzy, storm and rage as of unique kind.

Wyverns, as a name suggests, are similar to wyrns or Lindworms - another name for _germanic dragons_, - they have _2 limbs and wings_. In western folklore, drakes were considered same as dragons, but over time the term had changed to characterize _drakes as wingless 4-legged smaller creatures_ related to dragons. It is important to note presence of dragons in alchemy - notably within a concept of union of opposites - represented as a caduceus, closely related to god Mercurius, this idea will be later further developed, as currently an overview of dragons is required in relation to other species.

Previously discussed in the [introduction of dragons](#dragons), <a href="https://wiki.spiralknights.com/Dragon_Scale" target="_blank">Dragon Scales</a> are used in crafting of <a href="https://wiki.spiralknights.com/Dragon_Scale_Mail" target="_blank">Dragon Scale set</a> and <a href="https://wiki.spiralknights.com/Omega_Shell" target="_blank">Omega Shell</a>.

The <a href="https://wiki.spiralknights.com/Omega_Shell" target="_blank">Omega Shell</a> mentions Tortomega specie: `shield created from the armor of a Tortomega`. As drakes are not considered flying creatures, they could plausibly serve as ancestors of tortoises and then tortomega, connected by being reptilian and following a theme of divine. As tortoises could be considered descendants of dragons in this cosmology, both dragons and tortoises are considered divine in real-world mythology.

The <a href="https://wiki.spiralknights.com/Stone_Tortoise" target="_blank">Stone Tortoise</a> shield does not use dragon scales in its alchemy, only <a href="https://wiki.spiralknights.com/Drake_Scale" target="_blank">Drake Scales</a>. It seems, that tortoises were related, as reptiles, to drakes and dragons. The presence of <a href="https://wiki.spiralknights.com/Omega_Shell" target="_blank">Omega shell</a> in the same alchemy path from <a href="https://wiki.spiralknights.com/Drake_Scale_Shield" target="_blank">drake scale shield</a> and direct upgrade of <a href="https://wiki.spiralknights.com/Stone_Tortoise" target="_blank">Stone Tortoise</a>, may be a hint at tortomega's ancestry.

As descendants of dragons, tortomega were resistant to fire: `A shield alchemized from the shell of a tortodrone. The plates used in its construction provide some protection against the elements of fire and freeze` (<a href="https://wiki.spiralknights.com/Primal_Shell" target="_blank">Primal Shell</a>). Frost is reminiscent of Blinding Abyss and Underworld, but also of real-world tortoises being cold-blooded species and, potentially, referring to s specific tortoise species which live in a cold climate. It is also here we point out ability of tortoise to hibernate in winters, similar to a tortodrone migration: `Now, the tortodrones are being called on the Long Migration. Even the Strangers do not know the reasons for this mysterious event but these giant, robotic tortoises can be glimpsed traveling through the clockworks` (<a href="https://wiki.spiralknights.com/March_of_the_Tortodrones" target="_blank">March of the Tortodrones</a>).

We propose, that tortomega are the separate, conscious specie, comprising the civilization, responsible for creation of tortodrones. As tortoises are positioned as different specie from tortomega, as it is implied that a significant difference exists for that distinction to be made within the alchemy path. It can be anything starting from anatomical differences, to habitat, or other evolutionary traits as far as drakes differ from tortoises. The name "tortomega" has a postfix of "mega", which must be inspected.

Based on <a href="https://www.merriam-webster.com/dictionary/mega" target="_blank">Merriam-Webster definition</a>, "mega" refers to metaphorical or literal scale, power, greatness, which, when observed within the context of tortomega specie, means vaguely a great tortoise or, a giant tortoise.

This definition is also fitting for tortodrones, as they are one of the largest, although artificial, mobile creatures found on Cradle. Tortodrones are bipedal and have large amount of skills and capable powers. Exploration of tortodrones currently goes beyond current discussion, and will be explored in the [tortodrones section](#anatomy-of-tortodrone-and-crimsonite), but an essential conclusion can now be made through the semantics of the alchemy path.

Tortodrones are constructs either built in image of other specie, one implied to be tortomega, or by some different civilization in an image of great beasts - giant tortoises, tortomega. As the latter scenario is uncharacteristic of devilites, as they do not use such themes and symbolisms on regular basis - as seem in the corporate design of grim gates and more primal totems, the first scenario seems to us as thematically fitting. One of _tortodrones being designed in an image of tortomega_.

Another connection, which is important in the context of tortodrones and tortomega is:

- `A terrifying shield that combines the dual-crushing power of a gorgo and the mythical tortomega` <a href="https://wiki.spiralknights.com/Gorgomega" target="_blank">Gorgomega</a>, and <a href="https://wiki.spiralknights.com/Gorgofist" target="_blank">Gorgofist</a>
- `A shield created from the armor of a Tortomega` <a href="https://wiki.spiralknights.com/Omega_Shell" target="_blank">Omega Shell</a>

Here a closer look at the alchemy tree must be made: while drakes are descendants of dragons, <a href="https://wiki.spiralknights.com/Dragon_Scale_Shield" target="_blank">Dragon Scale Shield</a> is a 5-star upgrade - by this logic <a href="https://wiki.spiralknights.com/Wyvern_Scale_Shield" target="_blank">Wyvern Scale Shield</a> could be a specie being at transition of dragons to drakes, but this logic fails as previously established, drakes and wyverns do not belong to a single habitat, one being terrestrial and other aerial. Another way to look at it is the alchemy path and continuous disclosure of ancestry and relations though gear progression from game design perspective. Considering again real world definition of drakes, with addition of tortoise, the latter could be further evolution of drakes. Taking this in account, as well as dragon set alchemy path, <a href="https://wiki.spiralknights.com/Omega_Shell" target="_blank">Omega shell</a> could mean that tortomega are a different specie, related to both dragons and tortoise, based on its naming scheme.

At that same time <a href="https://wiki.spiralknights.com/Chromalisk" target="_blank">chromalisks</a> emerge. As they lack wings, they also may be descendants of drakes, with wyverns during that time remaining in the skies.

The <a href="https://wiki.spiralknights.com/Wyvern_Scale_Shield" target="_blank">Wyvern Scale Shield</a> being in upgrade of <a href="https://wiki.spiralknights.com/Drake_Scale_Shield" target="_blank">Drake Scale Shield</a> but required for <a href="https://wiki.spiralknights.com/Dragon_Scale_Shield" target="_blank">Dragon Scale Shield</a>, having <a href="https://wiki.spiralknights.com/Chroma_Tear" target="_blank">Chroma Tear</a> as the rest of dragon-themed items, may connect them all under a single ancestry as well as place wyverns as a potential species that either were at a transition to drakes, or older than drakes yet of same dragon ancestry. Despite the ancestry, we must keep in mind the difference in habitat.

Considering this, it may be established that _tortoises were descendants of drakes, which are descendants of dragons_. _Form tortoise tortomega emerged as a different conscious specie while still being ancient reptilian creatures with shells_. Further timeline will be stemming from an idea, that tortomega are conscious, organized specie, a descendants of tortoise, drakes and finally dragons. The logic behind this concept will be discussed next.

#### Tortodrones' Creators

Considering the similarity in naming of tortoises and tortomega and lack of any non-mechanical tortoise creatures, apart from a single stone shell of, supposedly, tortoise, presence of a tortoises is the main hint, through which tortodrone creators' specie may be uncovered.

Here we will advocate for tortodrones being built in image of a bipedal tortomega, as tortodrones themselves, so that tortodrone creators are tortoise-like specie, advanced and skilled enough to engineer and mass-produce those constructs, while discussing other possibilities based on presented in-game content.

##### Gremlin Scenario

The one and only candidate for such specie with engineering skills are gremlins, which would mean, that they are far more ancient than Clockworks makes them seem. And yet, tortodrones don't fit thematically and design-wise to be gremlin creation, as it will be later explored, the themes surrounding tortodrones are of stone megaliths, forests, - Gloaming Wildwoods specifically, - and an established architectural presence. Gremlins in that regard may be linked to grim gates in the Ancient Grove, as those have several mounted monitors of similar gremlin design. On the other hand, this can be further proof of gremlins working with Undercorp in recent times. Tortodrones have a relation to devilites, same as gremlins. Gremlins share a connection with devilites, whom they outsource their work: `Analysis of the data collected from these offices indicates that devilite corporations are outsourced by gremlins in order to design and manage various projects that include weapons specifically engineered to target Spiral Knight squads` (<a href="https://wiki.spiralknights.com/Work_for_Idle_Hands" target="_blank">Work for Idle Hands</a>).

Gun puppies are present within the ruins of wildwoods, sky islands, and scarlet fortress - all of these factors, while seem as compelling evidence for gremlins being said specie, again, does not fit thematically, - that of a relation with graviton/shadow and electron/elemental technology and their placement in relation to different locations within Clockworks. The point regarding gun puppies will be discussed in the [stone constructs section](#stone-constructs).

The rest of connections will will be explored in the [arrival of Undercorp section](#chapter-vi-arrival-of-undercorp), but the gist being the following: graviton technology allows linking of material realm with the Underworld, manipulation of gravity and capacity to inflict otherworldly shadow damage, which had to be in greater development and application, if gremlins adopted it earlier in the timeline. But, the observed focus of gremlin technology is mainly elemental damage and shock. Crimson Order is an exception here, as its' members - Warmaster Seerus specifically (`It is thought to have been reserved for use against other members of the Crimson Order` - <a href="https://wiki.spiralknights.com/Dark_Retribution" target="_blank">Dark Retribution</a>), - utilize shadow damaging bombs as well as several [other instances](#cradle-defenses), making shadow damage seem as of greater danger and secrecy within gremlin society.

An important note should be made: if gremlins did engineer tortodrones present on Cradle, that would mean that Clockworks were built either during that time or after, but remained within realm of gremlin influence, which would not explain presence of the Great Colony in a sense that colonies are not the homeworlds, but a dependent regions controlled externally and established by a greater empire of that specie, with an assigned emperor or a king. One entity close to this concept is implied to exist king Tinkinzar. The truthfulness of Tinkinzar's existence will be explored later in [chapter on gremlins](#gremlin-empire). In the context of tortodrones, this would mean, that gremlins salvaged this regions for Cradle while being present there.

This idea makes gremlins seem as less plausible candidate for tortodrones' creators, as there are tortomega themselves. Based on ideas, discussed earlier, - mainly a distinction between tortoise and tortomega, - they may seem as a more likely candidate, compared both to gremlins and devilites.

##### Devilite Scenario

While remaining at that point of analysis it is important to address another element of the setting, connected both to devilites and tortodrones - shining sigils found within the <a href="https://wiki.spiralknights.com/Call_of_the_Colossi" target="_blank">Call of the Colossi</a>.

Those sigils, or rather ritual circles, have same symbols that are used by devilites, but, in case of tortodrones, their parts and even shells are surrounded in much simpler design-wise circles of a _pale white mineral_.

Considering overall design of those circles, even outside of the meaning of devilite ritual circles, but considering presence of dark matter corrupted tortodrones, this _seems more of a measure to protect deactivated tortodrones from tampering_, utilizing same magic as devilites themselves use, and, as later will be seen, [undead Kat Tribe](#kat-tribe) in the Moorcroft Manor.

Excluding devilites themselves as potential creators of tortodrones, from the fact that they had to tempter with the constructs in the first place, only a civilization with similar knowledge of minerals can exist, which would assemble tortodrones with those physics in mind. This demonstrates, that the technology underlying tortodrones is similar to one of devilites, but not exact, suggesting a 2 scenarios:

- Devilites would adapt tortodrones to utilize not dark matter, but as later seen, crimsonite, while remaining in the physics of minerals.
- A different civilization has a potential to work with devilites, as gremlins did, to create tortodrones, while utilizing prior's knowledge of _minerals as power sources_.

##### Isorian Scenario

Isorians also should be noted as a potential lead, as suggested by shape of <a href="https://wiki.spiralknights.com/Ancient_Plate_Armor" target="_blank">Ancient Plate Mail/Set</a> as well as `items fashioned in the ancient, veiled homeland of the tortodrones` (<a href="https://wiki.spiralknights.com/Ancient_Prize_Box" target="_blank">Ancient Prize Box</a>), which do fit anatomy of Isorians, so they had to uncover existence of tortomega at some point in time. This suggestion frames civilization behind Spiral Order as creators of tortodrones and were inhabiting at some point in time a remote land, referred as the veiled homeland.

Even if tortodrones came from a different planet, captured by the Core, a connection with devilites and technological advancement would be recorded by the specie as they should be developed enough for such complex construction begin. And yet, Spiral HQ is unaware of any more information regarding tortodrones. Although this idea won't be completely discarded, overall and widespread presence of Isorians does not seem accurate, as there are a few other species present, suggests that some other civilization had invented tortodrones.

##### Tortomega Scenario

At last, there remains a duality in the theme of limitless rage of tortodrones and their veiled, serene even, as suggested by the <a href="https://wiki.spiralknights.com/Ancient_Prize_Box" target="_blank">serene naming convention of ancient items</a>, homeland. This duality must be kept in mind for further mechanical analysis of tortodrones and corrupted tortodrones. Notions and inconsistencies discussed above make tortomega as one remaining specie, plausible skilled enough to engineer tortodrones.

#### Symbolism of Stone

There are a few references to titans in a context of either heavy armors or armors made of stone:

- `A suit of artifact armor that is said to have been worn by titans` (<a href="https://wiki.spiralknights.com/Ancient_Plate_Armor" target="_blank">Ancient Plate Mail</a>).
- `A vestigial helm whose weight makes it unwieldy to all but those with titanic strength` (<a href="https://wiki.spiralknights.com/Ancient_Plate_Helm" target="_blank">Ancient Plate Helm</a>).
- `items fashioned in the ancient, veiled homeland of the tortodrones` (<a href="https://wiki.spiralknights.com/Ancient_Prize_Box" target="_blank">Ancient Prize Box</a>).
- Mossy design of <a href="https://wiki.spiralknights.com/Troika" target="_blank">Troika</a>, similar to other ancient-themed items. Despite troika having Spiral Order reskin as well as wielded by Spiral Order - as <a href="https://wiki.spiralknights.com/Izola" target="_blank">Izola in hall of Heroes</a>, it seems this design was acquired rather recently, after Skylark crash-landed on Cradle, compared to different themes of items in the alchemy path of <a href="https://wiki.spiralknights.com/Cobalt_Armor" target="_blank">Cobalt armor</a>.
- `A large, powerful shield made to resemble a creature's shell` (<a href="https://wiki.spiralknights.com/Stone_Tortoise" target="_blank">Stone Tortoise</a>). The creature in question is a tortoise.
- Design of <a href="https://wiki.spiralknights.com/Omega_Shell" target="_blank">Omega Shell</a> points at Tortomega. Tortomega is mentioned and is of same design as <a href="https://wiki.spiralknights.com/Stone_Tortoise" target="_blank">Stone Tortoise</a>, albeit darker, purple even.
- `A legendary suit of armor said to imbue the wearer with the rage of the titans` (<a href="https://wiki.spiralknights.com/Rageous_Plate_Mail#Rageous_Plate_Mail" target="_blank">Rageous Plate Mail</a>) - another instance of link between rage and titans, but here also a connection to older interpretations elements, relation to normal damage and rage.
- Stone is mentioned in <a href="https://wiki.spiralknights.com/Stone_Tortoise" target="_blank">Stone Tortoise</a> and in Ancient Plate Mail and Helm, as well as costumes of the same ancient design:

  `Within the cool, stony interior of this helmet` <a href="https://wiki.spiralknights.com/Serene_Tailed_Helm" target="_blank">Serene Tailed Helm</a> and <a href="https://wiki.spiralknights.com/Ancient_Plate_Shield" target="_blank">Ancient Plate Shield</a> on a first glance may not fit, by presence of, we believe, spirals and energy symbol, as they are associated with Spiral Order's alchemy and technology of their shields.

  This similarity to Spiral Order designs is also present in Valkyrian armors, such as <a href="https://wiki.spiralknights.com/Heavenly_Iron_Helm" target="_blank">Heavenly Iron Helm</a> and its 5-star alternatives in the alchemy tree of <a href="https://wiki.spiralknights.com/Angelic_Helm" target="_blank">Angelic Helm</a>, having same Energy symbol and overall shape suggesting anatomical and cultural similarities of Spiral Order and Valkyries, although the species are distinguished from each other: `It retains many divine properties celestial beings possess but lacks their weakness to fire` (<a href="https://wiki.spiralknights.com/Heavenly_Iron_Helm" target="_blank">Heavenly Iron Helm</a>). Could it be, that valkyries are related to Spiral order over the different periods of time?

Based on those references to stone and titans, a link may be established between said titans, stone, tortodrones, as their exterior is made of stone, gun puppies, tortoise, and finally, tortomega.

Based on counterarguments presented in favour of gremlins, isorians or devilites being tortodrones' creators, we believe, due to this common theme of stone, tortomega have most potential to being that species, despite the presented vagueness of both their identity and the time period in question.

Yet, this does not explain naming convention of titans, mentioned a few times in the above descriptions. We see them as relating to stone, which places them with the rest of this ancient time period. The name itself, titans, creates cultural associations from mythology, such as _jotun, giants of norse mythology_, _titans of greek mythology_, and potentially, _fomorians of irish mythology_. The latter will make sense later in the analysis as several common motifs will be found relating to all of the interpretations of giants/titans in the setting.

It is due to this narrative we will consider tortomega as the titans, mentioned in the equipment discussed earlier.

So far at this point of the analysis we will consider **tortomega being this extinct not species, but an entire civilization of titans, responsible for existence of tortodrones**.

#### Veiled Tortodrone Homeland

Tortomega would settle in the <a href="https://wiki.spiralknights.com/Ancient_Grove" target="_blank">Ancient Grove</a> (`Contains various unique items fashioned in the ancient, veiled homeland of the tortodrone` <a href="https://wiki.spiralknights.com/Ancient_Prize_Box" target="_blank">Ancient Prize Box</a>), where their ruins are, reminiscent of the style of carvings on tortodrones and [related gear, alchemized from the ancient shells](https://wiki.spiralknights.com/Ancient_Shell#Usage).

We suggest that Ancient Grove is part of the Gloaming Wildwood, and all of the woods were inhabited by this civilization, of tortomega.

This can be proven by both locations contain same type of architecture, evident by stone gun puppy statues and unique glowing mushrooms present across the biomes. The same statues and mushrooms are present in the <a href="https://wiki.spiralknights.com/Starlight_Cradle" target="_blank">Starlight Cradle</a>. Then, only statues remain in the <a href="https://wiki.spiralknights.com/Aurora_Isles" target="_blank">Aurora Isles</a> and <a href="https://wiki.spiralknights.com/Wolver_Den" target="_blank">Wolver Dens</a>, suggesting that prior to Cradle dividing those locations and placing them into skydomes, all of them were close in proximity within a territory inhabited by tortomega, close enough for glowing mushrooms to spread, as well by the same architecture, built by somebody inhabiting the geographical region.

It must be also noted, as Starlight Cradle, Gloaming Wildwoods and Aurora Isles all have large blocks made of dark stone with the glowing valestone-like spiral carved in its' sides, glowing only at night time of encompassing the regions skydomes.

It is unknown weather those regions could be considered as the `veiled homeland`, so it might be that the entirety of the habitat is left unseen and greater than suggested by areas available from the Clockworks, as evident by wildwood, not all of them are encased into Clockworks' skydomes. This idea of a greater volume of Clockworks remaining unexplored is also vaguely pointed out by Biotech in the haven Lab regarding Almire: `there were massive citadels housing Almire's armed forces and great estates for its noble houses ... We assume the kingdom is still a smoldering ruin somewhere`, that is, if the "somewhere" is on Cradle, rather than a lost planet, from which the landmass kingdom was taken into Cradle.

#### Extinction of Dragons

At some point in time, dragons were hunted by currently unknown party, which gave rise to the [creation myth](#creation-myth).

With dragons overthrown, whose powers reshaped the planet (`created the world in its passing: its fire the sun, its bones the mountains` - <a href="https://wiki.spiralknights.com/Storm_Dragon_Helm#Storm_Dragon_Helm" target="_blank">Storm Dragon Helm</a>) changing terrain (`its rage became magma rain, its breath a typhoon` <a href="https://wiki.spiralknights.com/Raging_Dragon_Helm#Raging_Dragon_Helm" target="_blank">Raging Dragon Helm</a>) and creating storms.

The <a href="https://wiki.spiralknights.com/Frenzy_Rider_Mantle#Frenzy_Rider_Mantle" target="_blank">Rider Mantles</a> refer to 3 gods using their respective elements to `carve worlds from stone` - the meaning of carving worlds from stone may also refer to a construction of castles found within Clockworks. The notion of gods is often accompanied with divinity which for the most part is symbolized by the heavenly kingdom - this possible relation will be kept in mind and serves as a basis for this mostly speculative section.

But, to achieve further progress in identification of both tortodrones and tortomega, we should approach from a point of the analysis of a different civilization - valkyries of heavenly kingdom.

<h3 align="center">Chapter <code>IV</code>: Valkyries of Heavenly Kingdom</h3>

Overall designs of <a href="https://wiki.spiralknights.com/Rage_Prize_Box" target="_blank">Rage Prize Box</a>, <a href="https://wiki.spiralknights.com/Stormy_Prize_Box" target="_blank">Stormy Prize Box</a>, and <a href="https://wiki.spiralknights.com/Frenzy_Prize_Box" target="_blank">Frenzy Prize Box</a> suggest existence of a different faction. This group's designs differ greatly from any tortomega stonework designs, and are most similar to Valkyrian and Spiral Order gear in respective themes and designs:

- `A helm worm by heavenly guardians who watch over a kingdom hidden atop a snow-covered/magma-covered/wind-swept mountain` (<a href="https://wiki.spiralknights.com/Avenger_Helm" target="_blank">Avenger Helm</a>)
- `A beautiful helm made to resemble a heavenly guardian` (<a href="https://wiki.spiralknights.com/Angelic_Helm" target="_blank">Angelic Helm</a>)
- `A priceless helmet whose name denizens of the Underworld dare not mention` (<a href="https://wiki.spiralknights.com/Valkyrie_Helm" target="_blank">Valkyrie Helm</a>) and the above have the very similar designs, including imagery of a spiral, and refer to a particular kingdom with theme of heaven.
- `The helm of one who defied the gods and stormed/razed the gates of a heavenly kingdom` (<a href="https://wiki.spiralknights.com/Champion_Helm" target="_blank">Champion Helm</a>), suggests an existence of a faction possessing same elements as `heavenly guardians` (<a href="https://wiki.spiralknights.com/Angelic_Helm" target="_blank">Angelic Helm</a>), but being at war with them.

  It is mentioned that the helm belongs to `one who defied the gods`, and <a href="https://wiki.spiralknights.com/Rider_Mantle" target="_blank">Rider Mantles</a> suggest that those belong to 3 gods of familiar elements. The helm of one defying itself is extremely similar to <a href="https://wiki.spiralknights.com/Ancient_Plate_Helm" target="_blank">Ancient Plate Helm</a> whose belonging was rather ambiguous due to conflicting origin and themes. Despite this relation, it remains an outlier due to sharing of 3 elements with the valkyrian equipment, as a single or potentially 3 entities defying gods of the according elements.

  Another possible party, who can be seen as a candidate for ones storming the gates of heavenly kingdom is the [Kat Tribe](#kat-tribe), as it succeeded in its endeavour to siege Owlite Academy of Magics. Although currently this is only a speculation based of the most generalized similarities, not the themes, as elemental and divine designs of 3 elements does not fit the curse-adjacent themes of Kats and their armor designs, at least in armors' transmuted forms acquired from the mysterious alchemy station.

- <a href="https://wiki.spiralknights.com/Rider_Mantle" target="_blank">Rider Mantles</a> have prismatic elements incorporated in their designs, specifically, <a href="https://wiki.spiralknights.com/Wings_of_Fury#Wings_of_Fury" target="_blank">Wings of those element</a> or <a href="https://wiki.spiralknights.com/Wings" target="_blank">regular prismatic wings</a>.
- Sigils on <a href="https://wiki.spiralknights.com/Rider_Mantle" target="_blank">rider mantles</a> do not resemble anything else seen on Cradle, even fiendish sigils or <a href="https://wiki.spiralknights.com/File:Enchanter_Aura-Equipped.png" target="_blank">Owlite enchanted symbols</a>.
- `A brilliant, white helm belonging to a heavenly warrior` (<a href="https://wiki.spiralknights.com/Heavenly_Guardian_Helm" target="_blank">Heavenly Guardian Helm</a>), - it has Spiral Order energy symbol and design similar to <a href="https://wiki.spiralknights.com/Azure_Guardian_Helm" target="_blank">Azure Helm</a>/<a href="https://wiki.spiralknights.com/Mighty_Cobalt_Helm" target="_blank">mighty cobalt helm</a>, this may also connect heavenly kingdom and Spiral Order as from the same if not similar time period, or possibly being related.

  Can it be that past Spiral Order was of those exact heavenly warriors? Considering the design, <a href="https://wiki.spiralknights.com/Divine_Avenger" target="_blank">Divine Avenger</a> it might have been created during that period of time, but presence of curse symbolism contradicts it. It is important to note here, that Spiral Order, one that comes from Isora, does not have mastery of elemental damage, as evident by <a href="https://wiki.spiralknights.com/Archilus" target="_blank">Archilus</a>: `Elemental resistant armor and shields are adapted from Owlite technology. Though the Owlites themselves no longer exist, their amazing elemental mastery lives on in this gear`, but their technology allows for curse to be lifted through <a href="https://wiki.spiralknights.com/Pickups#Capsules" target="_blank">Remedy</a> - if we consider this mechanic diegetic.

  If Spiral Order was at some point related to heavenly kingdom, it must have happened far into the past, if not fully unrelated, which would require then an in-depth explanation for the design similarities. The latter scenario is possible if the equipment is adapted literally - in its designs and culture of Spiral Order on Cradle, with the original designs remaining currently unknown, with a hint being more strategic equipment, such as <a href="https://wiki.spiralknights.com/Cobalt_Armor" target="_blank">cobalt armors</a> and <a href="https://wiki.spiralknights.com/Padded_Armor" target="_blank">padded armors</a>, which thematically are different from mythological themes heavenly warriors. We will keep this paradox in mind, until we will cover both parties.

Based on a design of <a href="https://wiki.spiralknights.com/Gilded_Griffin" target="_blank">Gilded Griffin</a> and its description: `A beautiful pistol named after a great, noble beast. Its golden frame was believed to provide light within the impenetrable darkness of the Underworld`, - there must have been an Underworld present, if only this handgun was of later times, as well as referring to a griffin - it has anatomy similar to a dragon, especially with its recognizable muzzle, now having 4 legs and wings, and back horns reminiscent of the Drakon sprite. This _notion of depicting ancient and powerful creatures is present also within castles' architecture_, as their origins are also have to be discussed, but the similarity in designs may bring heavenly kingdom and those castles closer in their common origin. While the handgun itself serves here as a reference for dragons and griffins, we will return to it in the context of location its [creation in the timeline](#gunslinger-priests).

Based on what could those handguns be attributed to valkyries? Those handguns possess multiple damage types, while Spiral Order of modern times is mostly unaware of shadow damage, and barely, of elemental, fully relying only on normal and piercing damage, as during times of Morai wars.

Regarding a scenario of Isorians being the heavenly kingdom in question - not enough clues currently are present for them to be such, apart from a similarity in design of the gear, specifically [the Spiral](#concept-of-spiral), which will be covered in relation to Spiral Order.

#### War of Dragons and Valkyries

As dragons perished, their influence was unleashed and documented as the [creation myth](#creation-myth). Then we have suggested that tortomega seemingly inherited the aspect of rage as those are descendants of dragons.

So far no other civilization is present on Cradle, which might have had similar designs to <a href="https://wiki.spiralknights.com/Rider_Mantle" target="_blank">Rider mantles</a> apart from valkyries. Due to this, we propose, that <a href="https://wiki.spiralknights.com/Rider_Mantle" target="_blank">Rider mantles</a> do belong to heavenly kingdom of valkyries. It is then a question of what has happened back then in order for those gods to exists, to `carve worlds from stone` (<a href="https://wiki.spiralknights.com/Rider_Mantle" target="_blank">Rider mantle</a>).

Due to name of valkyries itself, as well as the name of heavenly kingdom, we suspect, that Valkyries had managed to attain godhood through those powers of storms, rage and frenzy (`A legendary suit of armor thought to be worn by a god` - <a href="https://wiki.spiralknights.com/Storm_Rider_Mantle#Storm_Rider_Mantle" target="_blank">Rider Mantles</a>). it is then a question of how this transpired, with a suggestion of a war, which had led to dragons paradoxically being extinct while allowing for a world to be created from their innate power. This, for now paradoxical nature, we believe, point to a specific theme within ancient myths.

- `An enchanted helm crafted into the visage of beast who some believe created the world in its passing: its fire the sun, its bones the mountains` (<a href="https://wiki.spiralknights.com/Storm_Dragon_Helm#Storm_Dragon_Helm" target="_blank">Storm Dragon Helm</a>).
- `An enchanted helm crafted into the visage of beast who some believe shaped the world in its passing: its frenzy started the mighty winds, its scales became the shadows` (<a href="https://wiki.spiralknights.com/Frenzy_Dragon_Helm#Frenzy_Dragon_Helm" target="_blank">Frenzy Dragon Helm</a>).
- `An enchanted helm crafted into the visage of beast who some believe razed the world in its passing: its rage became magma rain, its breath a typhoon` (<a href="https://wiki.spiralknights.com/Raging_Dragon_Helm#Raging_Dragon_Helm" target="_blank">Raging Dragon Helm</a>).

This war to dragons as beings to hold or contain power to allow world to be made, and heavenly kingdom may be seen as a similar concept established in the _Mesopotamian epic - The Battle between Marduk and Tiamat_, and the _Babylonian creation myth - Enuma Elish_, and a greater idea, also found in alchemy - of order emerging from chaos, as described in the [initial covered of the Nameless Realm](#nameless-realm).

Goddess Tiamat is associated with the primordial chaos and sea, but only later she is described as a serpent. She was defeated by Marduk, implied to be the god of thunderstorms. After her defeat, her body was split by Marduk in two halves. From them, heavens and earth were created.

This seems as a possible inspiration for the [creation myth](#creation-myth) involving dragons. The interpretation of Goddess Tiamat as a dragon, as previously stated, was a later development, but it is one interpretation that has settled in popular culture, specifically in the universe of "Dungeons and Dragons". We believe this is important, as is known that some inspiration from a existing fictional works were initially taken as the inspiration, later developed and build upon: `Haven's original look resembled something similar to a Ald'ruhn from The Elder Scrolls: Morrowind. As you might imagine, it really didn't look right` (<a href="https://forums.spiralknights.com/en/node/20773" target="_blank">10 things you didn't know about Spiral Knights</a>). It is also in relation to the lore of Elder Scroll, dragons are considered primordial entities, responsible for the existence and form of its cosmology, and later being hunted by Nords, who initially were worshipping dragons.

Considering those themes, we suggest, that dragons were hunted by valkyries of heavenly kingdom.

#### Castles

As later seen by [stone constructs](#stone-constructs), tortomega had skills to construct defenses, traps, and gun puppies. As all of those constructs are present within most of castles, notably <a href="https://wiki.spiralknights.com/Scarlet_Fortress" target="_blank">Scarlet Fortress</a>. It can be argued that flying Scarlet Fortress has no connection to Tortomega, but the common and shared architecture itself suggest, that somebody had to carve it consistently over the construction of those castles. Potentially even tortomega assistance in castles' construction. This vagueness must be kept in mind as we will return to the relation of tortodrones to Underworld.

Both Gloaming Wildwoods, as an instance of assumed tortomega civilization, and castles, have similar imagery and depictions of dragons. Yet castles and discussed earlier equipment are implied to belong to heavenly kingdom, as only latter have more fine-grained depictions of dragons, a sign of possible acculturation of both civilization or taking inspiration directly from dragons.

The scenario would seem fitting in the case of tortomega being similar or partially inspired by Fomorians from Irish mythology, specifically in their role as ancient opposition to a divine across Ireland. This motif we cover in the [Fomorians section](#fomorians-and-irish-mythology), as a later explanation for the _single eye symbolism of the titan gates of the Arcade_.

A disappearance of tortomega civilization at some point had happened, same as dragons, remaining only in crafting materials and environment. Different reason for their extinction can be discussed:

- Being defeated by Heavenly Kingdom. Although it is implied by Spiral Order, that it is Underworld who led to creators of tortodrones' downfall: `leading Spiral HQ to believe that the Fiends are somehow linked to the disappearance of those once-mythical beings. In order to discover what the Fiends are up to, you will need to find a way to unlock one of their Grim Gates and travel through it` ([March of the Tortodrones](<https://wiki.spiralknights.com/March_of_the_Tortodrones_(Mission)>)).
- Tortomega were ones of the Heavenly Kingdom, but that would conflict with the established themes of celestial kingdom belonging to Owlites, a we will discuss in [their own analysis](#owlites-and-valkyries-of-heavenly-kingdom).

  This is a major roadblock, as we will later see, the heavenly kingdom is the Owlite and Valkyrie kingdom, which had established itself within the floating structures of the Scarlet Fortress, that is, if the heavenly kingdom was not of tortomega and later reestablished, recontextualised by valkyries - as this seems far more unlikely.

There are a few possible ways to resolve this:

- Valkyries of heavenly kingdom are as ancient as tortomega civilization.
- The heavenly kingdom is recontextualised. That is the heavenly kingdom of dragons - `The helm of one who defied the gods`, as the gods are either dragons ones with that same power as stated in <a href="https://wiki.spiralknights.com/Raging_Rider_Mantle#Raging_Rider_Mantle" target="_blank">Rider Mantles</a>: `A legendary suit of armor thought to be worn by a god who used rage to carve whole worlds from stone`.

_It seems as if there were indeed multiple, separated by culture creation myths, and yet, they are retellings of a singular timeline of events, obscured by mythology of each culture and civilization_.

Apart from heavenly kingdom, there are Owlites, which had inhabited halls of almost the same architecture, - of the Owlite Academy of magics. Owlites are associated with vengeance and divinity (`Wielding it fills you with righteous vengeance` <a href="https://wiki.spiralknights.com/Grey_Owlite_Shield" target="_blank">Grey Owlite Shield</a>). Apart from it, the <a href="https://wiki.spiralknights.com/Divine" target="_blank">divine themed</a> items and gear, including <a href="https://wiki.spiralknights.com/Heavenly_Guardian_Armor" target="_blank">Heavenly Guardian Armor</a>, would not match to any of the presented currently civilizations. So the possibility of heavenly kingdom being related to Owlites is still there, moreover, highly likely and will be discussed [later](#owlites-and-valkyries-of-heavenly-kingdom). As of now, Owlites are brought up as ones inhabiting a location of similar architecture, of castles.

The sigils of riders' mantles must be pointed out, as they are unique. There also exists a set of sigils, seemingly related specifically to Owlites - <a href="https://wiki.spiralknights.com/File:Enchanter_Aura-Equipped.png" target="_blank">the enchanted aura</a>. Those sigils are more similar to regular devilite sigils, but the aura itself is present only within a roster of Owlite items, suggesting that it, if related, comes from a seemingly different period of time, one resulting of Owlite research. Considering it, then, those sigils will be kept in mind when analyzing possible interactions of heavenly kingdom and Underworld, such as [sealing of legion of Ur within Underworld](#legion-of-ur) and overall Owlites' advancements regarding darkness at [times of Kat tribe invasion and Kataclysm](#chapter-viii-kat-tribe).

Within castle halls images of dragons were carved, these castles are the following:

- The <a href="https://wiki.spiralknights.com/Scarlet_Fortress" target="_blank">Scarlet Fortress</a> - one of larger castles, as it takes up entire in-game skybox. This would fit with the idea of a kingdom in the sky, or hidden on top of the mountains, as stated by <a href="https://wiki.spiralknights.com/Avenger_Helm" target="_blank">Avenger Helms</a>: `heavenly guardians who watch over a kingdom hidden atop a ... mountain`.

  Scarlet fortress is stated to be `drifting endlessly in the void of the clockworks`, and as evident by presence of spookats, was at some point in possession of Owlites and possibly valkyries. So this ability of flight, if not granted by the Clockworks, may be of innate laws of cosmology.

  There are some examples of floating structures:

  - `A latent strand of energy that floats throughout the Clockworks ... its too large to properly distill into Energy` (<a href="https://wiki.spiralknights.com/Static_Clinger" target="_blank">Static Clinger</a>).
  - `massive negative energy anomaly has surfaced above the Core ... mass of negative energy` (<a href="https://wiki.spiralknights.com/Kora" target="_blank">Ending in Fire - Kora</a>).

- <a href="https://wiki.spiralknights.com/Royal_Jelly_Palace" target="_blank">Royal Jelly Palace</a>
- <a href="https://wiki.spiralknights.com/The_Silent_Legion/Cryptic_Statuary" target="_blank">Cryptic Statuary</a>
- <a href="https://wiki.spiralknights.com/Owlite" target="_blank">Owlite Academy</a>/<a href="https://wiki.spiralknights.com/Candlestick_Keep" target="_blank">Candlestick Keep</a>
- <a href="https://wiki.spiralknights.com/Moorcraft_manor" target="_blank">Moorcroft Manor</a>
- <a href="https://wiki.spiralknights.com/The_Gauntlet/Last_Stand" target="_blank">Gauntlet</a>, or rather, <a href="https://wiki.spiralknights.com/Arena" target="_blank">arenas</a> in general, all have a unique red and brown tapestry, yet possessing architecture of Scarlet Fortress and of other aforementioned castles.

Based on this, as well as overall state of the castles, it is plausible that the main part of the heavenly kingdom of valkyries, with its unique tapestry and carpet designs, represented as a [tower, bastion, or a rook](https://wiki.spiralknights.com/Scarlet_Fortress), if <a href="https://wiki.spiralknights.com/Candlestick_Keep" target="_blank">Owlite/Candlestick keep</a> icon and chess theme to be considered, _belongs to a greater structure in possession of valkyries, as part of physical heavenly kingdom carved from stone, considering the size of the Scarlet Fortress alone_.

##### Crypts

Castle-related locations, such as Owlite Academy and Moorcroft Manor do have crypt-like locations, reminiscent of crypts within the <a href="https://wiki.spiralknights.com/Inner_Sanctum" target="_blank">Inner Sanctum</a> of legion of Almire, although not currently related apart from relation to burial, might point to culture's traditions and customs.

Although establishment of crypts within the former Owlite Academy and Moorcroft Manor would seem fitting for valkyries as a warring species, if attempting to rely on norse mythology, its burial customs does not seem to be present here nor to match event through the lens of interpretation and derived inspiration, which further suggests existence of multiple sources of inspiration behind present civilizations.

Regarding burial traditions, there are graveyards, which have same designs of coffins as in, for example, Moorcroft Manor and <a href="https://wiki.spiralknights.com/Inner_Sanctum" target="_blank">Inner Sanctum</a>, possibly suggesting that burial customs either had changed over time, of role of those structures was different. This temporal aspect must be kept in mind for the analysis of the [fiendish statues](#fiendish-statues) designs.

Overall theme of heavenly kingdom and valkyries seem to point that the kingdom in question and valkyries being its guardians, is a stand-in for, fittingly, Valhalla, with themes of afterlife being present across many of their structures. While that seems possible, the strata of coffins must yet to be analyzed.

As it was covered earlier in the [graveyards section](#graveyards), those places by design seem to be heavily related to Underworld. While there was no, under current theory, established connection between valkyries and Underworld explicitly, there is still a question remains behind builders of those places.

In that context, the size of the coffins does differ. Notably, within hall of heroes, behind <a href="https://wiki.spiralknights.com/Sylvin" target="_blank">Sylvin</a>. This coffin seemingly was build to house figures of knights' stature. If those coffins exist, while remaining the same shape and model, what can be said about other instances of such coffins present across Owlite Academy and Graveyards?

The most prominent evidence of Almire using large coffins was in the end of Legion of Almire - <a href="https://wiki.spiralknights.com/Legion_of_Almire/Inner_Sanctum" target="_blank">Inner Sanctum</a> and <a href="https://wiki.spiralknights.com/Legion_of_Almire/Cryptic_Cache" target="_blank">Cryptic Cache</a>. There is also Torin's, warrior or Almire, <a href="https://wiki.spiralknights.com/File:Scenario_Room-Graveyard_variant.jpg" target="_blank">tier 2 and 3 scenario room</a> - the coffin there is large.

Very likely the entirety of the necropolis did belong to Almire, as there are texts and tomes found within the sanctum, which itself is built seemingly by people of Almire, and not of a previous civilization.

As regarding graveyards themselves and Moorcroft Manor, the burials are same as of Almire. Moreover, zombies are found within Candlestick Keep. This is important due to the fact that all undead warriors of Almire have practically the same skull shape and features, with only <a href="https://wiki.spiralknights.com/Zombie#Carnavon" target="_blank">Carnavon</a> and <a href="https://wiki.spiralknights.com/Zombie#Slag_Walker" target="_blank">Slag Walker</a> having armor equipped, and both seen in the Firestorm Citadel.

Carnavons are also present in relation to summoned Black Kats, which are known to gain powers from consuming auras (`They carry the heaviest curse of all and mindlessly seek to devour magical auras. This constant consuming of power makes them incredibly strong` - <a href="https://wiki.spiralknights.com/Pembrooke#Dialogue" target="_blank">Pembrooke</a>), a key component of a living being on par with the soul, and capable of summoning curse-ridden undead. This aspect connects Almire, their civilization, and builders of castles.

Then, what kind of connection did Heavenly kingdom and Almire share, separated by many years? This will be explored later, but currently, this oddity will be kept in mind.

##### Draconic designs, Tortomega, Norse Mythology

Draconic and potentially devilite imagery is widespread in that architecture. It is similar to _Dragestil or Viking architecture, wherein dragon, or rather, serpent motifs are present in similar manner, as observed across Scarlet Fortress, Owlite Academy, etc._ Dragons in norse mythology symbolize chaos and destruction, which is why they were often used to decorate Viking longships.

In relation to dragons and further draconic designs, <a href="https://wiki.spiralknights.com/The_Silent_Legion/Cryptic_Statuary" target="_blank">Cryptic Statuary</a> and <a href="https://wiki.spiralknights.com/Royal_Jelly_Palace" target="_blank">Royal Jelly Palace</a> have the least of many draconic features, as well as being separated from the main mass of castles, freely floating across Clockworks, uncontained within the own skydomes or skyboxes as Scarlet Fortress.

A handgun, <a href="https://wiki.spiralknights.com/Raptor" target="_blank">Raptor</a>: `An ancient pistol imbued with enchantments designed to smite the fiendish creatures of the Underworld`, and <a href="https://wiki.spiralknights.com/Gilded_Griffin" target="_blank">Gilded Griffin</a> both have draconic designs, but here they are referred as _raptors and griffins_. Both handguns have piercing damage, suggesting, as previously mentioned, that their targets are in fact fiends or beasts, meaning that either Underworld must have been uncovered at that point, or dragons, under Spiral Order classification were beasts. But, due to the descriptions, the latter interpretation does not fit here.

If we to take those norse mythology inspirations, and apply them to tortomega, it may be that they are a stand-in for Jotun - a race of giants, opposing rest of families of gods - Aesir and Vanir of norse myths relating to valkyries. Jotun inhabiting woods, shores and mountains, seems to parallel to tortoise and tortomega inhabiting wildwoods and possibly mountains, as well as what preceded Aurora Isles.

At some point in time those castles were, as stated earlier, attacked by force with the same power of frenzy, rage and storms, with the main body of the heavenly kingdom remaining as it is, populated by Owlites, evident by spookats. Spookats are remnants of Kat Tribe known to invade Owlite High Academy of Magics, meaning that prior to [Kataclysm](#causes-of-kataclysm), it was under control of Owlites, and as we will explore, Valkyries. Then there would not be any reason for kats to go there apart from seemingly not guarded <a href="https://wiki.spiralknights.com/Edger" target="_blank">eternal study</a>:

- <a href="https://wiki.spiralknights.com/Owlite" target="_blank">Owlite Academy</a>/<a href="https://wiki.spiralknights.com/Candlestick_Keep" target="_blank">Candlestick Keep</a>
- <a href="https://wiki.spiralknights.com/Scarlet_Fortress" target="_blank">Scarlet Fortress</a>
- <a href="https://wiki.spiralknights.com/Moorcraft_manor" target="_blank">Moorcroft Manor</a>

Notably, all of location supposedly belonging to heavenly kingdom, except for Owlite Academy and Scarlet Fortress lack stone heads carved instead of fire bowls, with only dragon heads remaining in the arches.

The latter having significant similarity to Drakon battle sprites as in mentioned earlier idea of drakon sprites were shaped by the Core into an image of dragons, whose square muzzles were the main point of connection and similarity.

##### Fiendish statues

It is important to address the design of busts present within castles' halls of Scarlet Fortress, Owlite Academy and Moorcroft Manor:

- The stone on statue's forehead resembles the <a href="https://wiki.spiralknights.com/Prismatic_Dazzling_Gem" target="_blank">Prismatic Dazzling Gem</a>, which is related to Kats through idea of battle sprites being reincarnations of past civilizations. In that case being [Seraphynx](#seraphynx).
- The eyes most resemble <a href="https://wiki.spiralknights.com/Yesman" target="_blank">devilite yesmen</a> with their circular, dot-like shape, and small pits beneath, outlining the eye sockets.
- The mouth is also similar to devilites, having central tooth and 2 on each side. Based on <a href="https://wiki.spiralknights.com/Yesman#Yesman" target="_blank">yesmens'</a> underbite and other <a href="https://wiki.spiralknights.com/Yesman#Devilite" target="_blank">devilite overbite</a> within the textures, the lower jaw has 2 front teeth and upper jaw has 3 with one in the middle, similar to the statue.

But, as no devilites were encountered at that point in time, this architectural development could be some time later, during the time of [arrival of Undercorp to Cradle](#chapter-vi-arrival-of-undercorp), as proven by future appearances of Grim Gates. This conflicts with the proposed idea of tortomega not yet uncovering Underworld and constructing tortodrones, as described at [Arrival of Undercorp chapter](#chapter-vi-arrival-of-undercorp), as that was precursor to titans being extinct.

Across cultures, tall foreheads as well as presence of jewelry signifies wisdom, this can be applied both to dragons and devilites:

- Known devilites does not fashion themselves with trinkets presented on the statues.

  Although, this could be a time before Undercorp could have been established in a more modern setting of a corporation, or a fact that most of encountered devilites are white-collar workers (`The office minions of the Underworld are a disgruntled lot, attacking any unauthorized personnel on sight. While not terrible threats on their own, they can become far worse if one of their Pit Bosses gets a hold of them` <a href="https://wiki.spiralknights.com/Information_Module:_Devilish_Drudgery" target="_blank">Devilish Drudgery - Information Module</a>), without giving insight into the inner details of Underworld's society.

- If statues are of dragons, then it would be a different depiction of them, - with a greater relation to the Underworld's anatomy and physiology, or, it makes Underworld to appear very early in the timeline. It would also mean, that both titans and valkyries could be those castles' builders, given presence of dragons.
- If statues are of devilites or fiends, then it would seem strange for valkyries to build them, notably near crypts in the Moorcroft Manor.

  While for titans, which will later [cooperate with devilites](#arrival-of-undercorp), it would seem more fitting, as valkyries are not connected with shadow damage and Underworld until much further in the timeline we propose. And, as no Underworld was yet discovered, and valkyries do oppose it (`helmet whose name denizens of the Underworld dare not mention` - <a href="https://wiki.spiralknights.com/Valkyrie_Helm" target="_blank">Valkyrie Helm</a>), this seems as questionable design choice.

  Unless this was a later development. We consider this scenario as all of those locations lasted the most, as they are populated by Spookats - evidence of Kat tribe invading those location, meaning, that Owlites were there. And at that, far later point of the timeline, heavenly kingdom would've encountered devilites is several times. Carving them within their halls may be a symbolic gesture of a [yet-to-happen Valkyrian onslaught into the Underworld](#war-of-heavenly-kingdom-and-underworld). But, this suggestion does not follow any so far related myths nor their narratives, Valkyries of norse mythology included, - due to this, such suggestion of devilites being carved into the walls seems as a speculation, rather than a hypothesis.

- A possibility also exists of the castles being built by Spiral Order ancestors, but that would mean that all knowledge of elemental and shadow damage would at some point gone from Spiral Order, as they explicitly discover it on Cradle - shadow damage from devilites, and elemental from Owlites - as it will be discussed in [chapter on Isorians and Spiral Order](#similarity-to-heavenly-kingdom).
- An option, one that was mentioned in the [Ancient Titans chapter](#chapter-iii-ancient-titans) is based on an idea, that those are titans, depicting themselves at some point in time.

  This would lead to and idea, initially suggested by <a href="https://wiki.spiralknights.com/Dragon_Scale" target="_blank">dragon scale</a> description: `It reflects light with an otherworldly sheen`, that dragons are related to Underworld to a degree of being able to pass through it.

  While this would conflict with the established design of dragons, the potential designs of titans and tortoises, as similar to fiends design-wise would be not so far plausible.

  The key element is the <a href="https://wiki.spiralknights.com/Dazzling_Gem" target="_blank">dazzling gem</a>-like jewelry, which those castles were carved by valkyries, would mean that underworld is a different relation, but no such relation was discovered.

  On the other hand, such decorations for the depictions of builders of those structure would seem as more plausible, if we are to draw parallels with norse mythology - of gratitude and respect to titans, as builder of heavenly kingdom, an interpretation of the complex relationship between giants and valkyries from the norse mythology.

  This would place titans into close proximity of Underworld ecosystem and grant anatomy reminiscent of fiends, while not being as such. This hypothesis could explain the anatomy being similar to devilites'.

The only conflict is that devilites' flat anatomy of a face, rather that a dragon muzzle depicted here, with a stone similar to dazzling gem, which is attributed to Owlites. As anatomy of dragons is established, this makes this statues seem to belong to a different specie, likely titans themselves or devilites of later times in history of heavenly kingdom. We won't discard other cases of the statues' identities, but in order to move forward, we will consider titans as ones depicted on those statues.

This ability of dragons to travel across realms can also explain the scenario, where Isorians did not originate on Cradle nor on planet that was captured by Cradle, but rather on an unrelated planet, implied to be Isora, wherein dragons were already present, as stated by the <a href="https://wiki.spiralknights.com/Azure_Guardian_Helm" target="_blank">Azure Guardian Helm</a>: `The technique which weaves dragon scale seamlessly into the metal is a closely guarded secret`. The presence of Riders as once carving worlds from stone in this interpretation can be attributed to a different builders - this time being valkyries, meaning that the **castles with fiendish statues were assisted in building by titans, and the rest of castles build by valkyrian riders, gods**. This would respect both descriptions of riders as well as propose a plausible explanation for the statues, alluding to norse mythology.

Moreover, this exact narrative seems as the closest to the myth of how Asgard of the norse mythology was build - with an assistance of giants:

<BookCitation source="New World Encyclopedia: Asgard">

Describing the red band in the rainbow, the Prose Edda suggests that `that which thou seest to be red in the bow is burning fire; the Hill-Giants might go up to heaven, if passage on Bifröst were open to all those who would cross.`[11. Snorri Sturluson, Gylfaginning XV, Brodeur, 28.] This, the constant threat of invasion by the hostile giants (Jotun), represented a genuine fear for the Aesir.

---

In the mythic texts, the Aesir are thought to have constructed Asgard at some point in the mythic past. As Snorri suggests, `In the beginning [Odin] established rulers, and bade them ordain fates with him, and give counsel concerning the planning of the town; that was in the place which is called Ida-field, in the midst of the town. It was their first work to make that court in which their twelve seats stand, and another, the high-seat which Allfather himself has. That house is the best-made of any on earth, and the greatest; without and within, it is all like one piece of gold; men call it Gladsheim.` [16. Gylfaginning XIV, Brodeur 25.]

---

However, once these various homes and meeting halls were completed, the Aesir realized that they were relatively susceptible to attack. Fortuitously (or so it seemed at the time), a giant stopped by and offered to construct them an impregnable wall and a gate to protect their fledgling realm. However, his terms were quite steep, as he wished to receive in payment the hand of Freya in marriage, as well as the sun and the moon. The Aesir agreed to this bargain, on the condition that the work be completed within six months, and that he do it with no help (as they assumed that such a task would simply be impossible to complete). The giant stone-wright agreed to this once Loki convinced the Aesir to allow him to use his stallion to help in the building process.

</BookCitation>

This cosmology of heavenly kingdom, material realm, and of Underwrold with the Blinding Abyss seem to match here the general basics of norse mythology - Asgard as home of the Aesir and Vanir clans, Midgard being the realm of mortals, and frozen over underworld known as Niflheim.

#### Stone Constructs

Stone <a href="https://wiki.spiralknights.com/Gun_puppies" target="_blank">gun and rocket puppies</a> were invented by tortomega, resembling drakes, set to guard the halls of the castles. Gun and Rocket Puppies' exterior was made of stone with mechanical internals, as seen by the cracked shells of tier 1 turrets.

They had same design of dragons present in titans' castles, these designs would be later enhanced by gremlins with gun puppies of tiers 2 and 3, explicitly elemental, with the addition of elemental essences contained near spiral imagery carved into a stone slabs on top of gun puppies' heads (<a href="https://wiki.spiralknights.com/Gun_Puppy#Red_Rover" target="_blank">Red Rover</a>, <a href="https://wiki.spiralknights.com/Gun_Puppy#Slush_Puppy" target="_blank">Slush Puppy</a>, <a href="https://wiki.spiralknights.com/Gun_Puppy#Sick_Puppy" target="_blank">Sick Puppy</a>, <a href="https://wiki.spiralknights.com/Gun_Puppy#Sparky" target="_blank">Sparky</a>). The elemental essences in question are 5 star materials of icon like the <a href="https://wiki.spiralknights.com/Storm_Chaser" target="_blank">Storm Chaser</a>.

Gun puppies of tier 2 and 3 have more mechanical design, with the base at which the rotation of the turret happens, having bolts. Tier 1 gun puppies don't have any external mechanical elements, looking practically the same as the statues at <a href="https://wiki.spiralknights.com/Gloaming_Wildwoods" target="_blank">Gloaming Wildwoods</a>, <a href="https://wiki.spiralknights.com/Aurora_Isles" target="_blank">Aurora Isles</a> and <a href="https://wiki.spiralknights.com/Town_Square" target="_blank">Haven</a>.

Reskins resembling [gun puppy](<https://wiki.spiralknights.com/Drakon_(Gun_Pup)>) for Drakon battle sprite has more advanced design, as has exposed gun barrel present at the back, but also visible wires handing from where the mounting base should be. At the same time, Roarmulus twins or Project R, have artillery mounted on top of turrets.

Gloaming Wildwoods and <a href="https://wiki.spiralknights.com/Scarlet_Fortress/Cravat_Hall" target="_blank">Scarlet Fortress</a>, apart from the haunted Owlite Keep, have gun puppies which may point to their presence already at that time as the first sentient constructs. If,taken in account previous discussion regarding [origin of castles](#castles), presence of those constructs there can be attributed to a deeper relation of titans and valkyries, and heavenly kingdom as a whole, possibly to a times before supposedly titans stormed the gates of heavenly kingdom, as the technology, if it is diegetic, is present all of those locations.

Weather tortodrones were present during that time - is unknown as no signs of Underworld influence were present in these castles, apart from suggested [tortomega busts within the halls](#fiendish-statues), as the tortodrones were designed with the [evil eye symbol on their shells](#evil-eye) and connected to devilites even during the time when Skylark crash-landed to Cradle.

##### Lumbers as Constructs

On that note of constructs, <a href="https://wiki.spiralknights.com/Lumber" target="_blank">Lumbers</a> were likely gremlin invention, as they are more crude constructs, have evil eye seal placed on them instead of carefully carved, compared to tortodrone shells.

The lack of void/swarm gun puppies, but lumbers, may also point to them being of different nature, with lumbers being native to material realm and partially natural entities (as tree trunk used as their carcass).

A note, void gun puppies, while present in the game files, are not considered canon, as their design is of an older iteration.

#### Howlitzers, Dragons, and Drakes

Then, there are <a href="https://wiki.spiralknights.com/Howlitzer" target="_blank">howlitzers</a> present within regions mostly populated by the undead, and notably Owlite Keep, they have reptilian anatomy, and jaws similar to [fiendish statues](#fiendish-statues), 2 horns at the back of their skulls, depending on their tier, like [drakon battle sprites](#dragons). Those similarities make them seem as drakes or potentially dragons.

Due to [creation myth](#creation-myth), we would consider the original dragons being far larger than a howlitzer, in order for creation myth to be founded, in a general understanding when comparing dragons to any other species.

And yet, this concept seem to fail, as most of evidence on the identity of dragons suggests they were lesser in scale.

As a logical leap, the design of <a href="https://wiki.spiralknights.com/Drake_Scale_Shield" target="_blank">Drake Scale Shield</a> is the only one having its left side sharpened, while its upgrades have more rounded corners, but more visible scales, more reminiscent of spikes along the back.

Similar design choice of lack of spikes is seen in the <a href="https://wiki.spiralknights.com/Drake_Scale_Helm" target="_blank">Drake Scale Helm</a>, and due to this, we may consider general interpretation of drakes compared to that of dragons, as for them equipment such as <a href="https://wiki.spiralknights.com/Dragon_Scale_Helm" target="_blank">Dragon Scale Helm</a> exists.

If considered that drakes or dragons had to be undead in order for howlitzers to appear, then gun puppies would have to be invented later, unless they are meant to represent symbolic dragon, rather than an anatomically correct one, inspired by statues, rather than living beings.

Dragons on their death should have affected the environment within current theory, but at the same time, howlitzers are considered undead and found all across Cradle, same as spookats, meaning that something had to bring them back at such scale. The only powers known to be related to undeath, cause undeath, as it will be later seen, and be related to afterlife, ares the devilites of Undercorp and powers of curse, the Core, and Kataclysm. Those will be analyzed accordingly.

The prior, considering further relation of tortomega, then known as Titans, with the Underworld in the [Arrival of Undercorp section](#chapter-vi-arrival-of-undercorp) could be a potential reason for resurrections of dragons, but this idea as we will further see, would not be developed apart from presence of howlitzers in the Gloaming Wildwoods.

Lastly, howlitzers have a nose horn, which is not seen across dragons, apart from specific Drakon evolution, if we take existing dragon designs.

If we consider chromalisks being descendants of drakes, then drakes would be in between dragon anatomy and chromalisks', and among them one particular specie is of greater interest to us - salamanders. Only <a href="https://wiki.spiralknights.com/Chromalisk#Salamander" target="_blank">salamander</a> and <a href="https://wiki.spiralknights.com/Salamander_Mask" target="_blank">later salamander mask's alchemy tree</a> have a distinct nose spike. This seems as a more solid link to identifying howlitzers as drakes. Drakon evolution in that context would seem as attribution to drakes whom dragons could've encompassed in their diversity. Another case could be a further development of Drakon anatomy, as one embodying the totality of dragon anatomy and history, as [Seraphynx](#seraphynx) represent many different families of Kat Tribe based on their fur color and patterns.

So far, most of evidence suggest that howlitzers are dragons, but drakes have a benefit of being less known of across the setting and being related to currently present chromalisks through mythological interpretation of salamanders as modern-day descendants of dragons.

If we commit to the idea of valkyries slaying dragons, then it would not be far fetched for drakes falling to them too, resulting in the presence of their remains, brought back to life within the territory of heavenly kingdom and beyond. the question the is of how non-flying drakes managed to reach heavenly kingdom, which we do not have answer for so far, as of the case of wolvers being found in the Firestorm Citadel.

Within howlitzer ribcage a pulsing essence is present similar to essence orbs found on <a href="https://wiki.spiralknights.com/Gun_puppies" target="_blank">Gun Puppies</a>. All of howlitzers deal shadow damage, as an undead. Gun puppies of elements do have similar elemental core located on top, reminiscent of the nose horn of salamanders.

<h3 align="center">Chapter <code>V</code>: Isorians</h3>

Spiral Order originates from a planet known as Isora, - although Isora is not confirmed to be the Knights' specie homeworld, we will refer to it as such, as <a href="https://wiki.spiralknights.com/Galactic_Guardian_Helm" target="_blank">Galactic Guardian Helm</a> refers to this civilization: `A commemorative helm that pays tribute to the countless brave Isorian guardians that have protected spacefaring crews in their adventures across the stars` - an ancient spacefaring civilization known as Isorians.

The distinction between `Isorian` and `Isoran` must be made here. While from the spelling perspective both variants can be utilized, we believe that `Isorians` follows the pattern, seen in case of `Almire` / `Almirian`, where the name of the planet or a organizational body is altered by adding "-ian" or "-ians" ending to indicate affiliation. Here, `Isorans` can be used as a shortened form of the prior, depending on speaker's context and formality.

As for this document, we will refer to the civilization from planet Isora as Isorians.

Isorians had existed prior to the establishment of a modern Spiral Order, as there are references to a time `eons` before Skylark crash-landed on Cradle: `This suit was once worn by Isorian starfarers of eons long passed that stood watch over extrasolar operations` (<a href="https://wiki.spiralknights.com/Stellar_Sentinel_Suit" target="_blank">Stellar Sentinel Suit</a>). Furthermore, this military power structure is not referred explicitly as the Spiral Order, suggesting that Spiral Order is a relatively recent development, perpetuated by, for example, internal conflict:

- `Whether its crest is a relic from the Order of old or a creation from the Knights' time on Cradle is not immediately clear` (<a href="https://wiki.spiralknights.com/Aegis" target="_blank">Aegis</a>) - Aegis's description can be interpreted in many ways, but we will start from such as this one, in reference to Spiral Order.
- `A special saber used to resemble Isoran spacefarers of old as they sliced across the night sky` (<a href="https://wiki.spiralknights.com/Celestial_Saber" target="_blank">Celestial Saber</a>) - existence of a saber suggests a potential inspirations behind Isorian past military tradition which can be mapped onto real-world history.

_Conventionally, eon is greater than a thousand of years, a millenium, usually reaching up to millions of years._ This concept of a struature preceding Spiral Order of Isorians will be kept in mind until further development, and we will look at it in relation to other ancient civilizations. Further analysis will make its major goal to establish a relation and a timescale at which we could place modern Spiral Order and, if a possibility will present itself, their prior history through currently known means and arguments. We consider it important as one of more heated debates regarding Isorians is the question of their presence and involvement in Cradle's history.

#### Symbolism and Dragons

Further establishment of a precise time period when Isorians became a spacefaring race, is unknown. Despite this, a few hints are in fact present.

The <a href="https://wiki.spiralknights.com/Azure_Guardian_Helm" target="_blank">Azure Guardian Helm</a> description, apart from the shared guardian motif, states: `the technique which weaves dragon scale seamlessly into the metal is a closely guarded secret`. This was previously discussed in the [fiendish statues section](#fiendish-statues), and now it will be addressed in relation to Isorians and development of the Order as well as a general overview of their history.

Spiral Order awareness of dragons suggests at least 2 scenarios:

1. Spiral Order was established on the same planet, that was inhabited by dragons. That planet had to be later incorporated into Cradle, as heavenly kingdom and tortomega civilizations are implied to be there, as discussed in the [Ancient Titans section](#chapter-iii-ancient-titans).

   As <a href="https://wiki.spiralknights.com/Raiders_Prize_Box" target="_blank">Raiders</a> exist, and they bear same Spiral Order insignia of a spiral warden, on, for example, <a href="https://wiki.spiralknights.com/Raider_Buckler" target="_blank">Raider Buckler</a> or the symbol on hte prize box itself, as well shoulder pads' design similar to one of Almirian Crusaders, this marks raiders as potentially related and present in adjacent period of time as the kingdom of Almire. So far we have only designs, but, we will keep this ide in mind.

   Almire lacks warden insignia, but is present on Cradle. Yet, Cradle had remained undiscovered by modern Spiral Order and it does not have any technology explicitly related to Spiral Order or Isorians as a species, apart from a singular case which will be covered later - of a space vessel found in the [Ghost in the machine](#ghosts-in-the-machine) danger mission.

   The technology found on Cradle, including Clockworks, is not recognized by the Skylark crew, nor Almire or the derelict space vessel, a completely alien to Isorians.

   Considering that many worlds are implied to be harvested by the Core in order to build Cradle, the Clockworks themselves could potentially incorporate into themselves Isorian technology as Cradle was constructed. As, so far, it is a thematically inconsistent speculation, we will only keep it in mind for a scanrio when those motifs may de affirmed by more evidence of thematic similarities.

   Moreover, Cradle itself does not have any explicit relation to Isorians apart from ever-present imagery of a spiral, one also adopted by gremlins, as they build and deconstruct Clockwork tunnels. Then there are strangers, whose town of Haven does have the same spiral imagery, even if it is build upon Clockwork tunnels, as will be covered in-depth in [Strangers section](#strangers-and-haven).

   From those elements we can gather, as we see, only an omnipresent concept of a spiral, and unknwon chronological placement of Raiders, yet somehow related to Spiral Order. We will cover raiders in detail through the course of multiple iterations.

2. As we earlier suggested, Dragons have an ability to travel across disconnected locations and traverse through realm, given their nature as the oldest known creatures apart from inhabitants of Apocrean Realm.

   Under current framework this explanation is based on otherworldliness of dragons, recognized by the Spiral Order, as specified in <a href="https://wiki.spiralknights.com/Dragon_Scale" target="_blank">dragon scale</a>: `It reflects light with an otherworldly sheen`, as well as through the foundation of previous chapters.

   If items' and materials' descriptions are written by Spiral Order researchers, then this presents an fascinating wording of dragon nature. This is highly likely, considering that the author - a _biotech likely, - does not have full or precise knowledge for entries of items or materials_, that were developed or found on Cradle, which, of course, leaves space for speculation and filling in the blanks.

   At <a href="https://wiki.spiralknights.com/A_Revelation_in_Flames/Sunset_Steppes" target="_blank">Revelation in Flames - Sunset_Steppes</a> Rhedon mentions that [drakon battle sprites](#dragons) do in fact look similar to dragons: `They seem friendly. In fact they seem to behave just like the battle sprites I know. Only difference is they, uh, well, look like dragons`. This suggests that members of Spiral Order did know, prior to crash landing to Cradle, how dragons had looked in their general appearance to be recognizable. Weather those dragons were extinct on Isora, or a remains of the impression formed by homeworld culture, is a different question, which we will eventually discuss.

Now, there are other signs suggesting, that Spiral Order and dragons might exist near or even in the same period of time, as this temporal proximity is required for Isorians to visually identify those creatures as dragons.

- Spiral Order utilizes dragon scales in alchemy of <a href="https://wiki.spiralknights.com/Azure_Guardian_Helm" target="_blank">Azure Guardian Helm</a>: `The technique which weaves dragon scale seamlessly into the metal is a closely guarded secret`.

  Azure armor is of Spiral Order advancement, is the final upgrade of Cobalt Armor and <a href="https://wiki.spiralknights.com/Cobalt_Helm" target="_blank">Helm</a>, - `a high-performance helmet of the Spiral Order suitable for any adventure`, - that is confirmed to be of Spiral Order, same as <a href="https://wiki.spiralknights.com/Defender" target="_blank">Defender</a>: `A durable, high quality shield of the Spiral order that is suitable for any adventure`, then dragons might have been encountered and potentially hunted for scales.

  Unidentifined remains nature of those encounters and final fate of dragons. As <a href="https://wiki.spiralknights.com/Azure_Guardian_Armor" target="_blank">Azure Guardian Armor</a> is described as `a grand set of armor commonly donned by the leaders of the Spiral Order`, considering greater rarity items required for better gear, Spiral Order can be analyzed through a lens of inspirations used to create current theme of Spiral Order, that is, military traditions and implied culture.

- <a href="https://wiki.spiralknights.com/Dragon_Armor" target="_blank">Gold and Iron Dragons</a> - those are types of military units, later merged with Reckon Rangers.

  They specialized in high-profile Morai targets, likely during or before Morai wars. First of, this means that Spiral Order had taken dragons, either from myths, or by observing their living instances, for a naming scheme in their military structure.

  This pattern is usually utilized to symbolize specific characteristics of said animals.

- <a href="https://wiki.spiralknights.com/Dragon_Scale_Mail" target="_blank">Dragon Scale Mail</a> calls dragons `creatures of legend`, as if they were in fact extinct, being preserved in language, perception, image, and idea only in legends.

  This idea stands in opposition to one presented in the description of <a href="https://wiki.spiralknights.com/Dragon_Scale" target="_blank">dragon scales</a>: `An armored scale from what was thought to be an extinct creature`, that dragons had to be hunted in order for their scales to be harvested.

Based on, mainly, description of Drakons by <a href="https://wiki.spiralknights.com/A_Revelation_in_Flames/Sunset_Steppes" target="_blank">Rhedon</a>: `In fact they seem to behave just like the battle sprites I know. Only difference is they, uh, well, look like dragons`, the wording suggests that the appearances of dragons is commonly known, again, _either through cultural representation or direct encounter_.

#### Spiral Order and Dragons

And yet, examples above demonstrate, that neither of them could lead to a distinct status of dragons nor explicitly lead to any direct conclusion, as if those instances were spread across a large period of time.

Now, considering prior point, dragon scales are used in military, that might not particularly lead to dragons being hunted, as the same scales are found when going through Clockworks' beast-themes depths. Yet no dragons were encountered there. This allows us to interpret the fact dragons thought to be an extinct (<a href="https://wiki.spiralknights.com/Dragon_Scale" target="_blank">dragon scales</a>), in 2 ways:

1. Spiral Order believes that dragons _are extinct_, that the fact dragon scales are found in clockworks, means that they did inhabit Clockworks up until the time Skylark crashed, meaning that there is a population of dragons yet to be found, as scales had to appear from somewhere.

   It is important to note, that the method dragon scales are found - as a drop from enemies found in their according stratums and regions. It is a gameplay mechanic, one that remains vague in its diegetic accuracy.

   If the material drops are diegetic, then this would mean, that dragon scales are consumed or somehow collected and spread across Cradle by wildlife. _Dragon scales may be that widespread, if a particalr event would be at a cause, such a mass extiction_, returning to our idea of _dragons being hunted prior to Cradle by heavenly kingdom_.

   We must be kept in sight as a 5 star material, a rare material, found at lower Clockworks' depths from beasts specifically, or potentially alchemized from <a href="https://wiki.spiralknights.com/Primal_Spark#Treasure_Box_Tokens" target="_blank">Primal Sparks</a>: `A small wisp of the essential spirit of nature. It is of extreme value to the Spiral Order`, implying some sort of connection. The presence of the sparks we will keep in mind, as well as their in-game application, symbolism, and utilitary usage.

   Moreover, even if dragons are extinct on Cradle, their scales remain, marking Cradle or one of its composing planets as a plausible habitat for dragons. Then, another question is posed - from what part of Cradle did dragons originate as a specie, or where did they come from?

2. Spiral Order believes that dragons _are not extinct_ through the similarity of drakon battle sprites to dragons.

This seems as a less likely explanation, but a plausible one, if we contextialize:

- Battle sprites resembling dragons to a point that they had to be named like dragons
- The scales are used in military, of high ranking armors. Considering the ongoing war with Morai, source of such material would be at least a stategic value, if it indeed offers great defense.

From those suggestions, considering both presence of dragon scales on Cradle, the fact that dragons were with a high chance considered extinct on Isora when ever Skylark was launched, and perception of some creature as dragons through descriptions and dialogue, large accent on the legend of dragons, we lean to a conclusion, that _dragons were extinct due to Spiral Order harvesting their scales_.

This can be also affirmed by drawing parallels between Spiral Order and real world top-ranking units of military structures:

- The Chinese emperors often used sable fur in their robes, which led to the near-extinction of the sable species in some regions (<a href="https://royalsocietypublishing.org/doi/10.1098/rspb.2017.1979" target="_blank">Long-term archives reveal shifting extinction selectivity in China's postglacial mammal fauna</a>)
- European royalty and nobility frequently used stoat fur for their ceremonial robes. The demand for this fur led to significant declines in the populations of stoats.
- Japanese Samurai Armor. High-ranking samurai sometimes used tortoise shells and ivory in their armor and accessories. The demand for these materials led to the decline of certain turtle and elephant populations.

Then there is an animal-themed naming conventions across internal structure of the Spiral Order, preceding Recon Rangers. This is one instance seems more direct in comprison ti the rest, as an inspiration from real-world military tradition, unit, and division naming conventions.

Among them, Viking are of greater interest to us due to presence of Raiders - those warriors often used animal names and symbols, such as Berserkers, associated with a state of trance and fury. This is also remniscent of the rage motif as aone of primordial elements. Whil the general relain may not lead, currently, to any direct conclusion, what seems more plausible in this context, is the potential _celtic origins of the Spiral as an omnipresent symbol, integrated into past Isorian culture_. We will return to the concept of a spiral later in the analysis.

Spiral Order armors and uniforms resemble cultural image of medieval, mainly central european armor prior to Renaissance, apart from more distinctly modern instances, such as <a href="https://wiki.spiralknights.com/Padded_Armor" target="_blank">padded armor</a>. This allows for some room for medieval Europe military being used as an inspiration for Spiral Order, as one of directions to search through.

The definition or medieval is important here, for clarity, 10th to 16th century Europe is used as a reference point. <a href="https://wiki.spiralknights.com/Azure_Guardian_Helm" target="_blank">Azure Guardian Helm</a> looks similar to bascinet hounskull which dates to 14th century Europe. Based on this context of potential inspirations behind Spiral Order design we suggest that dragons were indeed hunted.

#### Utilitarian Alchemy

There is not a lot information about Spiral Order history in relation to alchemy. At that, <a href="https://wiki.spiralknights.com/Mighty_Cobalt_Armor" target="_blank">Mighty Cobalt Armor</a> is stated to be `An advanced set of Spiral Knight armor skillfully crafted using the most recently deciphered Clockworks technology` (<a href="https://wiki.spiralknights.com/Mighty_Cobalt_Armor" target="_blank">Mighty Cobalt Armor</a>). By preceding Azure Guardian armor, Azure Guardian armor itself then might be considered as one originating from Cradle, paralleling in than notion <a href="https://wiki.spiralknights.com/Aegis" target="_blank">Aegis</a>: `Whether its crest is a relic from the Order of old or a creation from the Knights' time on Cradle is not immediately clear.`

Considering that Azure armor is granted to most valuable members of the Spiral Order, we suggest it existing at least before Skylard had crash-landed on Cradle, - that the alchemy path prior to it is exactly this - _an alchemy, which transmutes given materials through a vague, as vague as medieval alchemy itself, recipes, into a desired results_. This idea, we propose, is at the the root of the theme of alchmy being utility-oriented, rather than its real-world counterpart, being a reflection of subjective context onto the external objective. Here, it is achieved through recipies, which in the context of a spacefaring civilization (`A special suit of armor designed specifically for knights on first recon of alien planets. This rugged suit protects against a variety of harsh elements` - <a href="https://wiki.spiralknights.com/Tri-Guard_Armor" target="_blank">Tri-Guard Armor</a>) would be invaluable, as they, by that logic, allow for creation of equipment withoutt preestablished, highly technological base of an `alien planet`.

To go with this concept of utilitary alchemy further, - this approach allows for manufacture of highly advanced gear in an area which is not well covered or adapted by Isorians, - that being Cradle. Due to this, due to the knowledge of energy, of alchemy, of a preexisting hierarchy within Spiral Order, those factors seems to suggest, that most of the equipment themes, - not the equipment itself, apart from carriers of the core themes, such as Azure Guardian Armor, - are native to Isora, and only though alchemy those are adapted by application of materials, found on an alien planet.

Due to convinience of alchemy within this explanation would justify mainly symbolic relation of materials and resulting equipment - as alchemy, by its real-world-inspired origins and as a diegetic mechanic, would allow for such interpretaion to be valid from the perspective of the source material.

If alchemy belongs to Isorians - who had introduces it on Cradle? Who build the <a href="https://wiki.spiralknights.com/Alchemy_Station" target="_blank">alchemy stations</a>, apart from regular ones we also search for a valid explanation on Mysterious Alchemy Machine and Sanctuaty Alchemy Machine, while having a seemingly universal symbol of either alchemy or an <a href="https://wiki.spiralknights.com/Orb_of_Alchemy#Orb_of_Alchemy" target="_blank">Orb of Alchemy</a>. The latter is identified by 2 characteristic golden curved frames positioned around a central orb. We will keep this question in mind.

Alchemy-based approach also puts the description of <a href="https://wiki.spiralknights.com/Aegis" target="_blank">Aegis</a> under same question of placement in chronology: `Whether its crest is a relic from the Order of old or a creation from the Knights' time on Cradle is not immediately clear`, - which equipment was invented by Spiral Order on Cradle and what was already present on Cradle prior to Skylark crash landing? Some items may not be related as per regular crafting. Such case was presented with <a href="https://wiki.spiralknights.com/Drake_Scale_Shield" target="_blank">Drake Scale Shield</a> alchemy paths' tree, whose elements are not places chronologically as they are presented on the tree itself. Those items are separated temporally and historically, which is, again, not represented in the alchemy tree itself.

Finally, the process of crafting that gear is called alchemy explicitly, not crafting although it is implied so. Alchemy, in that context will be examined after the analysis of the Clockworks.

##### Technology, Alchemy, and Isorian Redesigns

Shield are known to have energy source, which allows for bubble-like force field to be created as a primary protection measure (`A sturdy Defender upgraded with its own internal energy source for more effective protection` - <a href="https://wiki.spiralknights.com/Great_Defender" target="_blank">Great Defender</a>).

Most of shields have [Energy](#energy) symbol present:

- <a href="https://wiki.spiralknights.com/Aegis" target="_blank">Aegis</a> and its alchemy path.
- <a href="https://wiki.spiralknights.com/Ancient_Plate_Shield" target="_blank">Ancient Plate Shield</a>
- <a href="https://wiki.spiralknights.com/Darkfang_Shield" target="_blank">Darkfang Shield</a>
- <a href="https://wiki.spiralknights.com/Royal_Jelly_Shield" target="_blank">Royal Jelly Shield</a> and its alchemy path.
- <a href="https://wiki.spiralknights.com/Drake_Scale_Shield" target="_blank">Drake Scale Shield</a>, but its alchemy path lacks a direct representation of an energy symbol, remaining as a colored light dot.

For to be present on directly different civilizations, such as Jellies, potentially dragons or drakes, and ancient plates, we suggest that those are modified with Spiral Order technology. Apart from the gremlin Darkfang shield, which will be discussed within the context of gremlin civilization, _similar underlying logic_ may be applied, as discussed in [energy section](#energy), to armors, as in case of <a href="https://wiki.spiralknights.com/Ironmight_Plate_Mail" target="_blank">Ironmight Plate Mail</a> and its alchemy path, - cahracterized by the symbol of energy, located below neck on the armor's backplate.

It seems likely that, while inconsistent, **notion of Isorian technology being integrated into alchemized gear, is one that allows for items from different periods and epochs to be brought into reality while remaining or even amplifying its efficiency through futuristic technology of Isorians**.

The case of such items being adapted can be seem most clearly for the <a href="https://wiki.spiralknights.com/Crest_of_Almire" target="_blank">Crest of Almire</a>. The entities aligning themselves with the kingdom of Almire - <a href="https://wiki.spiralknights.com/Almirian_Shadow_Guard#Almirian_Shadow_Guard" target="_blank">Almirian Shadow Guard</a>, <a href="https://wiki.spiralknights.com/Carnavon#Carnavon" target="_blank">Carnavons</a>, <a href="https://wiki.spiralknights.com/Almirian_Crusader" target="_blank">Almirian Crusaders</a>, and <a href="https://wiki.spiralknights.com/Wheel_Launcher" target="_blank">Citadel wheel launchers</a> - have a different shape of the crest.

The shape of transmuted <a href="https://wiki.spiralknights.com/Crest_of_Almire" target="_blank">Crest of Almire</a> is the same as the <a href="https://wiki.spiralknights.com/Aegis" target="_blank">Aegis</a>, a shield made by the Spiral Order. But the entities above use <a href="https://wiki.spiralknights.com/Blackened_Crest" target="_blank">Blackened Crest</a> design and shape, alas larger.

Lastly, <a href="https://wiki.spiralknights.com/Almire_Furniture#Doodads" target="_blank">the restored Almirian Tapestry has angelic wings below the crown</a> at the roots of the black tree. This seems as a solid enough evidence for us to consider Spiral Order's notion of adapting preexisting designs and technology through alchemy into reality, rather than unreasonable but consistent design alteration.

Yet, we can not explain the design choice itself, as the tree roots and angel wings symbolism is not something common, unless we are to refer what <a href="https://wiki.spiralknights.com/Overgrown_Court" target="_blank">Nature Sprite said in the Overgrown Court</a>: `Yes, we nature sprites are the rain, the root, and the soil. But you are not like us. You are like the ones below. ... Good fortune, star-borne`, - we can attempt to link heavens, due to wings, to stars, as for Nature Sprites it could be essentially the same, as we will discuss later in the context of [the kingdom of Almire and its realtion to Nature Sprites and greater Spirit Mother](#almire-and-spirit-mother).

As it was stated that `Spiral Order has relied on alchemy as their primary means of creating the very arsenals that Knights have relied upon for centuries` (<a href="https://wiki.spiralknights.com/Alchemy_for_Beginners" target="_blank">Alchemy for Beginners</a>), we previously proposed, that the convertion of energy was also as old as alchemy, we can attempt to link this deep connection between alchemy of Spiral Order to the concept of energy, and alchemy of the real world.

We propose, that the candidate and inspiration to energy symbol may be a concept of salt in alchemy up to its symbol "🜔" and extended usage. The inverted energy symbol is similar to another symbol - saltpetre "🜕", a key component to gunpowder, which seem to be fitting to overall medieval-like inspiration of Spiral Order designs, and to be one used on military turrets. Apart from it, it can represent a lack of energy, symbolized by a darker red color, relating to the same color of energy counter once it reaches 0.

#### Auras and Souls

Isorians have auras and, possibly, souls. Auras are mentioned in the <a href="https://wiki.spiralknights.com/Pembrooke#Dialogue" target="_blank">Pembrooke</a> dialogue during <a href="https://wiki.spiralknights.com/Kataclysmic_Confrontation" target="_blank">Kataclysmic Confrontation</a>: `They carry the heaviest curse of all and mindlessly seek to devour magical auras. This constant consuming of power makes them incredibly strong`.

Cradle has property of making spirits return to material realm (`Why spirits return to the material realm is unknown, trough it is clear that many of the spirits within the Clockworks have come from other worlds` - <a href="https://wiki.spiralknights.com/Weight_of_Darkness" target="_blank">Weight of Darkness</a>). The <a href="https://wiki.spiralknights.com/Soul" target="_blank">souls</a> are observed for the first time at <a href="https://wiki.spiralknights.com/Blades_of_the_Fallen" target="_blank">Blades of the Fallen</a> and later in a few other places:

- <a href="https://wiki.spiralknights.com/Soul#Static_Soul" target="_blank">Static souls</a> in the Dry Docks of <a href="https://wiki.spiralknights.com/Ghosts_in_the_Machine" target="_blank">Ghost in the Machine</a>.
- Discovered <a href="https://wiki.spiralknights.com/Soul#Frozen_Soul" target="_blank">Frozen souls</a> near Amu-Sol in <a href="https://wiki.spiralknights.com/Heart_of_Ice" target="_blank">Heart of Ice</a>. They are confirmed to come from underworld as Everfrost had contained them, with Everfrost tower being demolished by Maulos (`The intel we've collected so far suggests that fiends utilize large deposits of the stuff to trap the souls of the lost within it, like some kind of icy prison. It would seem that Maulos, that horrible arch-fiend you just took down, had a different use in mind and was actually destroying this everfrost to unleash ... souls into the Clockworks` - <a href="https://wiki.spiralknights.com/Heart_of_Ice/Everfrost_Tower" target="_blank">Recon Ranger</a>, `A 'towering pillar' of everfrost and 'all the frozen souls it brings forth'` - <a href="https://wiki.spiralknights.com/Heart_of_Ice/Amu-Sol" target="_blank">Fiendish Memo</a>).
- Later released <a href="https://wiki.spiralknights.com/Soul#Fire_Soul" target="_blank">Fire souls</a> in Firestorm Citadel of <a href="https://wiki.spiralknights.com/Shadowplay" target="_blank">Shadowplay</a>.
- Relating both to the Swarm and to the Void, <a href="https://wiki.spiralknights.com/Soul#Void_Soul" target="_blank">Void Souls</a> are found in the Whitespace of the Core during the events of <a href="https://wiki.spiralknights.com/Dreams_and_Nightmares" target="_blank">Dreams and Nightmares</a>. So far Void remains unknown.

The souls, being both related to Underworld and Apocrea, presence of <a href="https://wiki.spiralknights.com/Soul#Freed_Soul" target="_blank">freed souls</a>, must be kept in mind. Entrapment of souls by Apocrea is described in the following manner: `Only souls keep these engines roaring, heard screaming across distant stars. Only souls can fill their void, sublime in its vast emptiness` (<a href="https://forums.spiralknights.com/en/node/91276" target="_blank">Allister Danford - journal entry</a>).

Auras, on the other hand, are mentioned only once by <a href="https://wiki.spiralknights.com/Pembrooke" target="_blank">Pembrooke</a>, while describing <a href="https://wiki.spiralknights.com/Black_Kat#Black_Kat" target="_blank">Black Kats</a>: `They carry the heaviest curse of all and mindlessly seek to devour magical auras. This constant consuming of power makes them incredibly strong. They were likely attracted to the power radiating from the ancient grimoires here in the Archives`.

Based on those descriptions it can concluded that both auras and souls are implied to be contain power.

This flow of power, possibly related to the concept of [Energy](#energy) can physically change one consuming it, as Black Kats. While Black Kats are seen directly and suggested to relate to auras, this cannot be said about Apocrean Engines. What really stands for those engines is unknown, but, as stated by <a href="https://wiki.spiralknights.com/The_Obsidian_Nexus" target="_blank">Lost Souls within Obsidian Nexus</a>, `The Apocrea are stuff of nightmares: a terrible legion of otherworldly phantasms whose only ambition seems to be trapping and devouring the souls of all life`, - souls are a way of sustenance for entities of Apocrean Realm, and a fuel for the engines, that is including a quote by Danford: `Within cities where geometry and madness share meaning, constructed from thought, from unnatural impulse, the Apocrea dream dark machines into being. Only souls keep these engines roaring, heard screaming across distant stars. Only souls can fill their void, sublime in its vast emptiness` (<a href="https://forums.spiralknights.com/en/node/91276" target="_blank">Allister Danford - journal entry</a>). There is still a notion of: `harvesting ... souls for some unimaginable purpose` (<a href="https://wiki.spiralknights.com/The_Obsidian_Nexus" target="_blank">Obsidian Nexus - Lost Soul</a>).

This may mean that souls and auras are similar if not the same metaphysical elements present within Isorians or any life in general, at that point. But then <a href="https://wiki.spiralknights.com/Pembrooke" target="_blank">Pembrooke</a> explicitly mentions auras, when souls are seem to be referred as souls by the majority, without naming them differently, this may lead to a potentially different nature of auras compared to souls, unless auras are souls in the cosmology of Spookats - the Kat tribe, which was related to Owlites and their research.

While souls were seen in the form of <a href="https://wiki.spiralknights.com/Soul" target="_blank">Lost</a>, <a href="https://wiki.spiralknights.com/Soul#Freed_Soul" target="_blank">freed</a>, [skull-wearing](<https://wiki.spiralknights.com/Lost_Soul_(Skull)>) as <a href="https://wiki.spiralknights.com/Phantom" target="_blank">Phantoms</a>, and <a href="https://wiki.spiralknights.com/Lost_Soul_of_Almire" target="_blank">Almirian Souls</a>, _auras were not_. When thinking of auras, the first thing is the accessories, but they does not seem to be identical to implied metaphysical auras.

##### Initial Analysis of Auras

In the Moorcroft Manor and in Haven, <a href="https://wiki.spiralknights.com/Pembrooke#Dialogue" target="_blank">Pembrooke</a> states: `black kats came out of some dark portal deep within the Clockworks and have raided the Moorcroft Archives! ... They carry the heaviest curse of all and mindlessly seek to devour magical auras. This constant consuming of power makes them incredibly strong. They were likely attracted to the power radiating from the ancient grimoires here in the Archives`.

As Black Kats are found in the library-like rooms, it is highly likely that those archived indeed have the same similar power as auras. And a few of those books were seen to have magical properties - ones found and placed on the <a href="https://wiki.spiralknights.com/Mystical_Tome_Stand#Stands" target="_blank">stands</a> in the <a href="https://wiki.spiralknights.com/Moorcroft_Prize_Box" target="_blank">Moorcroft Prize Box</a>: [Cursed, Mystical and Ancient stands](https://wiki.spiralknights.com/Cursed_Tome_Stand#Stands).

While cursed tome is affected by the curse, having similar manifestations of curse seen across many instances, and ancient tome remains the same, the <a href="https://wiki.spiralknights.com/Mystical_Tome_Stand#Mystical_Tome_Stand" target="_blank">mystical tome</a> is one of the most interest to us: `a magical tome filled with arcane symbols, esoteric formulae, and a few particularly rude doodles`.

As this tome is one associated with the Moorcroft Archives, we suggest, that it is a representation of a power, existing as the basis for auras. The nature-like motif of this implied aura will be deeper analyzed with the acquired context of <a href="https://wiki.spiralknights.com/Nature_Sprite" target="_blank">Nature Sprites</a> mainly due to similarity of those magics. Nature Sprites are connected to Almire, so the kingdom will be also covered later in its own [chapter](#chapter-vii-kingdom-of-almire). This idea will be further developed in the context of [Kat Tribe and Owlites analysis]().

This distinction can also be searched for across real world inspirations.

In various cultures and spiritual traditions, the concepts of the soul and aura are often viewed as distinct metaphysical entities, each with its own characteristics and significance. This distinction is reminiscent of a differnt inspiration.

In Buddhism, the term "atman" refers to the "subtle body" of an individual. This "soul" is eternal and transcends physical existence, as capable of existing beyond it.

And yet, it is subtle, its presence is felt through flowing though and around it omnipresent energy, life force, the prana. This _identified concept of a circulating life force, which is also everpresent is the aura_, that surrounds the body and represents its state. While the _atman is considered the true, subtle self, the prana is seen as a manifestation of one's state of being, its presence_.

It can be linked to the `radiating power` of the tomes, described by <a href="https://wiki.spiralknights.com/Pembrooke#Dialogue" target="_blank">Pembrooke</a>: `They were likely attracted to the power radiating from the ancient grimoires here in the Archives`. And it is also here, Lost Souls, even when their elemental alignment is acklowledged, are present as series of abstract shapes, to some degree [reminiscent of Whitespace itself](#symbolism-of-whdow-lairs).

To conclude, it is likely that both aura and soul of Isorians are metaphysical components, both interaction with realms beyond the material realm, capable of interacting with Underworld's physics and are sought after by Apocrea and Black Kats, in _all instances as a potential power source_. Yet we can't currently conclude of them being the same concept until we do the analysis of the [Kataclysm](#kataclysm), [kingdom of Almire](#kingdom-of-almire), and [Owlites](#kat-tribe).

##### Corporeal Body

As we have previously mentioned on Isorians being similar to people of Almire, through the course of this theory we cover arguments and evidence for and against the idea of kingdom of Almire being the same species as Isorians.

To continues this notion, we should note of the remaining ghostly representations of Almirians seem to look same as Spiral Knights, prime example being <a href="https://wiki.spiralknights.com/Torin" target="_blank">Torin</a> and <a href="https://wiki.spiralknights.com/Lord_Vanaduke" target="_blank">Lord Vanaduke's face</a> without his mask.

As [graveyards](#graveyards) were [discussed](#castles), we suggested that large coffins belong to people of Almire. Same coffins are located within the castles presumably belonging to valkyries, which had linked both parties, but now with an unidentified cultural similarity.

Yet, that does not explicitly mean that valkyries and Isorians are the same specie, - while the armor and overall themes of heaven and celestials are seem to match, [the prior will be related to Owlites though the course of the analysis](#heavenly-kingdom-and-owlites), a different species.

Spiral Knights are aware of concept of graveyards and do utilize it in their own culture, as seen in <a href="https://wiki.spiralknights.com/Blades_of_the_Fallen" target="_blank">Blades of the Fallen</a>, this being evident by the ceremonial tradition of Reverse Arms. Yet, Spiral Order and Isorians seem to be not aware of Underworld and other damage types - elemental and shadow.

As discussed in [crypts section](#crypts), presence of zombies as well as an entire roster of legion of Almire suggests, they seem to have a corporeal body with a skeletal structure.

As the main bridging element for Almire and Isorians similarity consists of the depictions and appearances of Lost Souls of Almire looking as Isorians, there exists a possibility of this similarity to be as simply explained as a design choice, restricted by game's scope, not requiring to model a significantly different design for Almirians. But, as the analysis takes all of the content at face value, we will continue with this notion onwards, noting, such as now, with current designs in mind.

At the same time, as Lost Souls are usually encountered as hostile entities of abstract translucent orbs, we can wonder weather Almirians were capable of presenting themselves as Isorian look-a-likes, or are as such. It is known that the fact of a Lost Souls being not aggressive does not lead to it being seem as somebody else - as in case of <a href="https://wiki.spiralknights.com/Lost_Soul" target="_blank">Lost Souls</a> within the Obsidian Nexus and in Haven, - they remain the same.

There is also an instance of Lost Souls possessing a [skull](<https://wiki.spiralknights.com/Lost_Soul_(Skull)>), those are seen in both Firestorm Citadel and Moorcroft Manor, suggesting that Lost Souls of Almire are the way they are depicted for a reason.

There are also <a href="https://wiki.spiralknights.com/Phantoms" target="_blank">phantoms</a>, which are undead capable of inflicting curse, and have the same characteristic skull with a turbulent glow. When phantom is defeated, it retreats to its more simplistic form of an ember-like entity.

Here, we must note of Lord Vanaduke's mask being of the similar nature, both as a potential lost souls connected with the concept of curse. But, Vanaduke's mask is also stated to be his vulnerability: `Our sensors show the mask is a source of power as well as a potential weakness` ([Monstrous Codex: Lord Vanaduke](https://wiki.spiralknights.com/Vanaduke)). Nature of Lord Vanaduke's curse will be discussed in the according section for the kingdom of Almire. As for the rest of the concept regarding lost souls of Almire, they could be seen as such due to proximity to the Nature Sprites, which are seen to have a method to combat the curse, but currently this notion must be kept in mind until the analysis of kingdom of Almire.

Finally, there are <a href="https://wiki.spiralknights.com/Soul#Fire_Soul" target="_blank">Fire Souls</a> after Firestoem Citadel began to crumble during events of <a href="https://wiki.spiralknights.com/Shadowplay" target="_blank">Shadowplay</a>.

**Due to this we suggest that the abstract Lost Soul parallels the subtle body, while the omnipresent energy, - the aura, grants it a degree of physicality and persistency in the material relam, be it a spirtial form, as of Almirians, or of presence within a physical object, being bound to it, now with application of alchemical and occult motifs** on top of this interpretaion within the presented setting.

The only inconsistency, which current proposal does not cover, is the existence of [abstracted, regular Lost Souls, which still possess a consciousness](<https://wiki.spiralknights.com/Lost_Soul_(SotA-Haven)>), such as during the events of <a href="https://wiki.spiralknights.com/Shroud_of_the_Apocrea" target="_blank">Shroud of Apocrea</a>, while persisting in the material relam, albeit surrounded by [resurfacing Apocrean Relam as slabs of obsidian in Havenhttps://wiki.spiralknights.com/File:Haven-Event-SotA-TownSquare.png].

#### Establishment of Order

Over an unidentified period of time Isorians were spreading across the space of material realm (`With this equipped, you can see a clear path across the night sky to countless worlds beyond` - <a href="https://wiki.spiralknights.com/Celestial_Nav_Helm" target="_blank">Celestial Nav Helm</a>).

We assume, that items of the <a href="https://wiki.spiralknights.com/Equinox_Prize_Box" target="_blank">Equinox Prize Box</a> describe an era prior to establishment of Spiral Order, as it is not called as such, but rather as Isorians as a whole, in reference to a planet, with an advanced enough technology for interstellar travel. Back at their prime they were capable of plunging into stars: `With this equipped, you feel like you could dive into the heart of a star` (<a href="https://wiki.spiralknights.com/Stellar_Sentinel_Suit" target="_blank">Stellar Sentinel Suit</a>), we can conclude that the Isorian civilization had existed for a while, eons, specifically.

There must be a distinction or rather, a point of Spiral Order establishment. The overall roster of those items links Isorians' past to Cradle based solely on the presence of equinox prize box and shared energy symbol, although the designs of equinox items are not like anything seen anywhere else, apart from common elements in equipment itself, shared with the rest of Spiral Order equipment.

Moreover, alchemical motif is also, we believe, present here. Specifically, in the case of the <a href="https://wiki.spiralknights.com/Celestial_Shield" target="_blank">Celestial Shield</a>. Its shape and duality in the description: `Cradle's equinox inspired the dual nature of this specialist shield, which protects against the dazzling light of day and the chill of the night in equal measure`, we believe, points to a depiction of a fifth divine element, present in medieval alchemy - <a href="https://www.alchemy-texts.com/assets/img/books/basil-valentine-azoth/VA04.jpg" target="_blank">Azoth</a>, or, the alchemical First Matter.

<BookCitation source="AZOTH or the way to make the hidden gold of the Philosophers - Brother Basil Valentin">

O most precious & most excellent foundation, from which all things are produced in these lands, though you are at first a venom adorned with the name of Fugitive Eagle. The first matter & the white & red seed of the divine blessing, in the body of which the drought & the rains are closed, which however are hidden from the impious because of the ornament & virginal dress scattered throughout the earth; your father and mother are the sun and the moon, the water and the wine also operate in you, the gold likewise and the silver in the earth, so that mortal man may rejoice therein in this way.

</BookCitation>

At some point in time, Spiral Order had to be established. The name of a Spiral, a symbol widespread across Cradle, was utilized in Isorian military. This must be for a reason, as no sny any concept comes that close as the Spiral being that prominent.

The Spiral seemingly holds meaning to Isorians as it is depicted both as ornamen as well as a central element, the latter being, for example, <a href="https://wiki.spiralknights.com/Swiftstrike_buckler" target="_blank">Swiftstrike Buckler</a>.

Near or prior to time of Spiral Order creation, spiral wardens are established as a military unit, as their armor's design is taken as Spiral Order symbol, a horse head - <a href="https://wiki.spiralknights.com/Spiral_Warden" target="_blank">warden</a>. This tradition carried into the future as Spiral Order was established (<a href="https://wiki.spiralknights.com/Warden_Helm" target="_blank">Warden Helm</a>).

We can also suggest that Wardens were inspired by fiendish Legion of Ur as if it was established earlier in the timeline, mainly due to both parties possessing same animalistic characteristics and strength. But, as it will be explored later, we suggest that Legion of Ur had to appear during the fall of Almire and was later sealed by actor of material realm in the [legion of Ur section](#legion-of-ur), specifically, by Valkyries of heavenly kingdom.

Legion of Ur or any fiend and even existence of Underworld itself was not seen by Isorians, despite presence of piercing weaponry. This idea, despite presence of Underworld and spirits being mentioned, is based on an idea that Spiral Order had not encountered nor named Underworld for it to develop specific shadow-resistant defenses, while focusing solely on piercing and normal damage.

##### Concept of Spiral

The exact point as well as the origins of Spiral Order were glimpsed over. It is important to analyze the concept of a Spiral as it is too universal to be looked past.

Currently, it is known, that the Knights incorporated concept of spiral at some point in time through naming conventions and image patterns. This spiral imagery is also widespread on Cradle, notably:

- Cradle's seemingly fractured Moon with definitive spiral on a landscape is present on its surface.

  As the spiral is always visible from any location, during the day when Skylark crash-landed and on replica moons within Clockwork skydomes, it can be concluded with certainty, that the moon is tidally locked, either through an artificial process or as a natural celestial body mechanics of Cradle. The presence of a spiral on its near side seems to be intentional, or may be a consequence of being located near Cradle, but as there are not many instances of natural spiral, - elemental wolvers, sporadically - this seems unlikely.

- <a href="https://wiki.spiralknights.com/Wolver#Ash_Tail" target="_blank">Ash tail</a> and <a href="https://wiki.spiralknights.com/Wolver#Frostifur" target="_blank">Frostifur</a> subspecies of <a href="https://wiki.spiralknights.com/Wolver" target="_blank">wolvers</a> have spiral pattens on their coats. A speculation for only those two wolver species possessing a spiral might be of an unnatural nature of them, a connection to [Underworld](#influences-of-underworld) and Fire Deity. But this proposal seem to fail, as we suggested an existence of a [Underworld cults](#fiendish-cults).
- <a href="https://wiki.spiralknights.com/Lumber" target="_blank">Lumbers</a> are constructed from a tree with spiral pattern on its bark. Same trees are potentially seen in the <a href="https://wiki.spiralknights.com/Jigsaw_Valley" target="_blank">Jigsaw Valley</a>. As discussed in the [lumbers section](#lumbers-as-constructs), they are likely gremlins' creation, implying some knowledge of seal magic, as seen in lumbers' elemental variants. This rare usage of shadow-related concepts, and also energy cell present in the <a href="https://wiki.spiralknights.com/Darkfang_Shield" target="_blank">Darkfang Shield</a>, will be covered accordingly.
- Clockwork tunnels' floor tiles. The tunnels are build by gremlins, which would mean that gremlins are aware of this concept, as they keep presence of spiral consistent across depths.
- Stone structures within the <a href="https://wiki.spiralknights.com/Ancient_Grove" target="_blank">Ancient Grove</a>.
- Whitespace of the Core has imagery and structures resembling spirals:
  - Walkways' square spiral patterns between level sections
  - Patterns of square spirals present on the gates - enemy gates and golden key gates.
  - Square spiral pattern is also observed within imagery of <a href="https://wiki.spiralknights.com/The_Artifact" target="_blank">Mysterious Consoles and the Artifact</a>.
- Square spiral stonework patterns are seen in Haven.
- <a href="https://wiki.spiralknights.com/Starlight_Cradle" target="_blank">Starlight Cradle</a> and the rest of Aurora Isles have a unique blocks with a glowing during the night spiral carved in them. The glow's color is reminiscent of <a href="https://wiki.spiralknights.com/Mineral#Valestone" target="_blank">valestone</a>, which is used in the <a href="https://wiki.spiralknights.com/Starlight_Hunting_Coat" target="_blank">Starlight Hunting Coat</a>.

At that point, the question of who build the Artifact and the Core, while is of separate nature, remains, and eventually will be explored in the [according section](#divine-and-whitespace-clockworks). But, this concept of a spiral must be examined as one extending beyond Cradle which requires understanding Cradle an its history first, in order to draw any conclusions. And, if taking in account knowledge of Spiral Order of dragons, weather or not dragons had originated on Cradle, there must be a solid reason for Isorian military be named with spiral in mind, reaffirming possible connection between Isorians and whatever past they may have with Cradle.

A safe speculation can be performed, one that is based on idea of separate histories of Isorians and Clockworks: assuming that **the Spiral is, at least partially, a universal or interstellar phenomenon, important enough to be replicated in many instances, even cultures and civilizations**, it may be related to other illusive concepts, such as other realm or a deity - a part of a different, omnipotent concept that remains undiscovered. But it remains a speculation as a connection is established purely though to lack of strong leads, but hints of relation. Yet again, the Core, and the design of Whitespace have to be examined later due to complex and interconnected context of Whitespace itself to other less known of concepts, such as the Void or the Swarm.

#### Morai

Now there are Morai and the Morai Wars, which had brought Isorians to the brink of extinction (`The Morai Wars have brought us to the brink of extinction` - [Spiral Knights: Prologue](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d5CrSNU-Wyg)).

Dragons were likely hunted by Spiral Order, with the reason behind it being the resource of dragon scales. It is valuable enough to be considered a military secret. This also implies that scales have some valuable properties.

What are those properties? All cobalt branch of alchemy does have piercing defenses:

- <a href="https://wiki.spiralknights.com/Riftlocker" target="_blank">Riftlocker</a> and <a href="https://wiki.spiralknights.com/Breach_Blaster" target="_blank">Breach Blaster</a> are piercing damage type weapons.
- <a href="https://wiki.spiralknights.com/Cobalt_Armor" target="_blank">Cobalt</a> armor and <a href="https://wiki.spiralknights.com/Defender" target="_blank">Defender</a> alchemy trees have piercing defense.

This can lead, based on enemy types present across Clockworks, that Morai, while they could be same as Isorians, were possibly beings, vulnerable to piercing damage, with their machinery also (`These firearms proved instrumental during the siege of Isora in breaking through the war machines of the Morai` - <a href="https://wiki.spiralknights.com/Riftlocker" target="_blank">Riftlocker</a>) susceptible to piercing damage, as well as their armor (`An enhanced pierce blaster designed to break through hostile armor` - <a href="https://wiki.spiralknights.com/Breach_Blaster" target="_blank">Breach Blaster</a>).

If items' descriptions are written by the Spiral Order researchers, then, it can be plausible for the <a href="https://wiki.spiralknights.com/Damage" target="_blank">damage</a> and <a href="https://wiki.spiralknights.com/Monster" target="_blank">monster classification</a> be also of the same origin.

##### Entity Classification of Morai

There are 2 cases to cover: weather Morai are an Isorian colony and are of the same specie, or, Morai are a different specie, based on their relation to piercing damage classification.

Beasts and fiends are weak to piercing damage, but only beasts and slimes can deal it. Yet there are no constructs nor armors that are vulnerable to piercing - this is a novel concept, as it does not fit to an established damage framework.

There are only a few members of Skylark Crew that are confirmed to fight in Morai Wars:

- <a href="https://wiki.spiralknights.com/Desna" target="_blank">Desna and Reckon Rangers</a>
- <a href="https://wiki.spiralknights.com/Rhendon" target="_blank">Rhendon and Scarlet Scouts</a>
- <a href="https://wiki.spiralknights.com/Euclid" target="_blank">Euclid and Alpha Squad</a>
- <a href="https://wiki.spiralknights.com/Ozlo" target="_blank">Captain Ozlo</a>

In relation to the siege of Isora: <a href="https://wiki.spiralknights.com/Padded_Armor" target="_blank">Pathfinder Armor</a> and its alchemy tree have specific strategic roles. From this earlier period of time, armors such as <a href="https://wiki.spiralknights.com/Circuit_Breaker_Armor" target="_blank">Circuit Breaker Armor</a>, <a href="https://wiki.spiralknights.com/Frostbreaker_Armor" target="_blank">Frostbreaker Armor</a>, and <a href="https://wiki.spiralknights.com/Emberbreak_Armor" target="_blank">Emberbreak Armor</a> all refer to an elemental core present within the armor and being hacked (`Armor with a hacked elemental core aimed at resisting fire. However, this non-standard modification creates other elemental weaknesses.` - <a href="https://wiki.spiralknights.com/Emberbreak_Armor" target="_blank">Emberbreak Armor</a>). This suggests that at least _basic understanding of the elements, without introduction to magic of higher rarity materials, was developed_.

Note on slimes. Slimes seem to be unique to Clockworks as then their hierarchy then would not be a novel discovery to the Spiral Order, as suggested by Kora: `Apparently, monsters within the slime family actually have a ruling aristocracy of elite slimes. These 'Royal Jellies' are enormous, selfish and ill-tempered slimes that live in opulent palaces that we can only guess have been squatted in as we do not believe slimes are capable of building structures` (<a href="https://wiki.spiralknights.com/Another_Trace" target="_blank">Another Trace - Kora</a>).

Could presence of Riftlocker also mean that the personnel of said war machines was the target, but not the constructs? This is plausible, but currently does not help with the identification.

If Morai are fiends, then this would certainly lead to Spiral Order's discovery of shadow damage and Underworld. While the prior is practically true, awareness of Underworld apart from Cradle is unknown. The only way we can look into Isorian understanding of Underworld is through their response on existence of fiends and lingering spirits on Cradle. Considering many different mentions of Underworld, and specifically mission description of <a href="https://wiki.spiralknights.com/Whipping_and_Mishandling" target="_blank">Whipping and Mishandling</a>: `After Recon Knights discovered a fiendish city known as Sol' Fork, Spiral HQ deployed a research team to station itself in the heart of the city and study the devilites within. Their finding have become the basis for our understanding of devilite culture and their motives for working with gremlins`, it seems that Underworld was discovered as it is, a separate realm, only on Cradle.

Lastly, the most likely scenario - Morai are simply Isorian colony, which had not, same as Isorians, encountered any non-material realm entities even with entirety of their technology. As Isorians are a spacefaring civilization, as most directly proven by existence of Skylark, Morai are one of Isorian colonies. As it was stated by celestial sets, that explicitly Isorians were spacefaring, it makes it seem as Isora was the homeworld for this civilization.

#### Isora and Cradle

As Isorians are a spacefaring civilization, we will discuss further several similarities between Cradle and Isorians in attempt to identify the nature of this relation.

##### Spiral Raiders

Across Raiders' equipment, <a href="https://wiki.spiralknights.com/Raider_Buckler" target="_blank">Raider Buckler</a> has the same Spiral Order symbol, but seems to be from a different period of time, preceding the celestial items. This can be resolved it 2 ways:

1. Spiral imagery is seen in celestial equipment, suggesting that it was utilized by Isorians from very early times, during the less technological age, one inspired by northern cultures. This similarity to valkyries and heavenly kingdom will be kept in mind.
2. It is not of native Isorian origin. It seem that at least a few other items could support that theory, - <a href="https://wiki.spiralknights.com/Raiders_Prize_Box" target="_blank">Raiders Prize Box</a> has <a href="https://wiki.spiralknights.com/Firestorm_Raider_Tunic#Firestorm_Raider_Tunic" target="_blank">Firestorm Raider Tunic</a>: `Treasure is at your fingertips and ash in your wake with this soot laden coat`, <a href="https://wiki.spiralknights.com/Firestorm_Raider_Helm#Firestorm_Raider_Helm" target="_blank">Firestorm Raider Helm</a>: `A pristine raider helmet, save for a few dings and a thick coat of ash`, and <a href="https://wiki.spiralknights.com/Firestorm_Skeggox" target="_blank">Firestorm Skeggox</a>: `An ornate, fiery axe favored by raiders for its versatility`, - these items of raider roster have fiery/ash themes, and as the name itself suggest, are meant to be associated with the Firestorm Citadel, or, although less likely, <a href="https://wiki.spiralknights.com/Firestorm" target="_blank">firestorm skill</a> of <a href="https://wiki.spiralknights.com/Drakon" target="_blank">drakon</a>, which is also referencing dragons: `Summon the power of true dragon fire to burn everything in your path`.

Note that there is gear of other elements: of frost and squall. Weather those elements are related to original three of dragons - is unlikely, but the pattern itself of naming common elements differntly is present. All of these items have spiral imagery: as weapons have spiral carved onto them, and costumes have spiral on their belt and other elements of equipment. Considering that dragons were a possible inspiration both for Spiral Order and Valkyries, with both containing norse mythology motifs, - can they be further connected in attempt to relate valkyries to Isorians as potentially the same species?

Another explanation for those items can be based on the development of Isorians, marking establishment of Spiral Order or its precursor far earlier in their history, with symbol of a spiral already being a staple for its predecessors.

Although it can be fitting, this does seem to align with current themes. Those themes are that of being a greater focus on Cradle and its inhabitants. For example the Equinox, which being on Cradle, but the theme of items relates to Isorian past. At the same time, as Almire will be explored as being a civilization of the same specie as Isorians, there's a very high possibility of different Isorian civilization being present near that time, one that invaded Almire and had witnesses Lord Vanaduke's actions first-hand. _If not for fire-themed items, raiders could very much fit to Isora rather than Cradle_, and this very reason seems to us as a relatively strong argument that there were other Isorian civilizations existing with Almire, of different culture and different location.

Considering that the norse mythology is most prominent here, <a href="https://wiki.spiralknights.com/Glacial_Prize_Box" target="_blank">Glacial prize Box</a> items must be examined in that relation. The topic of arctic region is highly important to a possible entities behind Undercorp's plot on Cradle, it is explored in the [nefarious imp and arctic plot section](#nefarious-imp-arctic-plot).

Both scenarios lead to the same question being posed - **how and when Isorians had to arrive to Cradle or one of its planets in order to have both less developed technology, - as raiders and Almire, - but also preserve Spiral Order symbolism - as strictly raiders?**

##### Spacefarers of Old

The terms `spacefarers of old` (<a href="https://wiki.spiralknights.com/Celestial_Nav_Helm" target="_blank">Celestial Nav Helm</a>) and `Isorian starfarers of old` (<a href="https://wiki.spiralknights.com/Celestial_Nav_Suit" target="_blank">Celestial Nav Suit</a>) may be linked to <a href="https://wiki.spiralknights.com/Aegis" target="_blank">Aegis</a>: `Whether its crest is a relic from the Order of old`.

By being referred by the phrase `of old`, and Spiral Order usually being mentioned in gears' description directly, it introduces a level of vagueness to Spiral Order origins.

If Aegis is of the order before Spiral Order, it must bear same emblem as Spiral Wardens, as well as presence of spiral patterns. And if raiders are even more ancient Isorians, then Warden had also to exist. Potentially, in a more medieval iteration.

This is the first explanation. The second explanation, which we have discussed earlier - one relying in the themes of relation to Cradle, of Spiral Order at some point arriving to Cradle in the past and remained there, explaining both raider low-tech gear and similarity of Isorians to citizens of Almire.

The other important point, which we believe, affirms the second scenario, is the presence of Isorian-like equipment within the Iron Hulk of a spaceship during the event of <a href="https://wiki.spiralknights.com/Ghosts_in_the_Machine/Iron_Hulk" target="_blank">Ghosts in the Machine</a>, suggesting that either Morai or Isorians had arrived to Cradle a few hundred of years prior to Skylark crash landing there. **If this has happened once, over a span of a hundered years, and given how ancient Isorians are as an interstellar civilization, the possibility of such event being repeated in the past is highly likely due to presence of the concept itself**.

Isorians had technology to allow interstellar travel for eons, it is then might not be a logical leap to conclude that at some point in time Isorians did in fact arrive to Cradle and their descendant became people of Almire and raiders, with the latter suspected to be one of the 2 kingdoms invading Almire. The detail of this state transitioning to the kingdom of Almire and raiders we will suggest in [the end of the analysis of the kingdom of Almire](#war-of-heavenly-kingdom-and-underworld).

##### Skylark

When thought of interstellar travel, it is believed that the time taken by the travel itself is considerably long, but, in case of Skylark and overall technological advancements of Spiral Order, this was solved, as based on the intro cinematic, Skylark has the required technology to travel those long distances.

Based on the earlier mention of eons regarding celestial cosmetics, Spiral Order or Isorians existed for quite a while, and such technology would be then expected or at least improved to the point it is seen currently.

Based on <a href="https://wiki.spiralknights.com/Reporting_for_Duty#Dialogue" target="_blank">Feron dialogue</a>: `After the Skylark crashed, its primary tearium core exploded, destroying a portion of the ship and leaving it without a main power source`, a fuel called tearium is used to power the engine as well as the ship itself (<a href="https://wiki.spiralknights.com/Reporting_for_Duty#Dialogue" target="_blank">Reporting for Duty - Feron</a>).

Skylark has at least 2 types of engines, one powered by tearium and one recovered and placed into the Lab, whose power supply is barely enough to power the complex, and it is designed similar to arcade gate pillars with distinct presence of Energy aura patterns.

We can identify the potential application of tearium through the analysis of the <a href="https://youtu.be/d5CrSNU-Wyg" target="_blank">intro cinematic</a>. Skylark, prior to reaching Cradle's star system was located in a tunnel. Based on the general understanding of Isorian advancements, we propose that it is a tangible, physical tunnel created by teh vessel for long-distance travel, rather than a storytelling tool. In this proposed context we consider tearium as a fuel derived of "to tear", such as to tear reguular space.

##### Thematic Connections of Isorians and Cradle

There are many items pointing to Isorians being related to Cradle:

- The aforementioned Raiders' [firestorm theme](#spiral-raiders).
- `Whether its crest is a relic from the Order of old or a creation from the Knights' time on Cradle is not immediately clear` (<a href="https://wiki.spiralknights.com/Aegis" target="_blank">Aegis</a>) - as discussed earlier, the vagueness here seems intentional.
- `The technique which weaves dragon scale seamlessly into the metal is a closely guarded secret` (<a href="https://wiki.spiralknights.com/Azure_Guardian_Helm" target="_blank">Azure Guardian Helm</a>) - as it was examined in relation to [both Spiral Order and dragons](#spiral-order-and-dragons), in the current context of Isorian origins it remains relevant.

  While dragons are in fact mentioned, the helm itself is of Spiral Order's medieval designs, and the set specifically lacks any relation to elemental or shadow, except for known piercing damage. So, this would mean that either dragons were present to some degree on Isora.

- `As it is often said, a knight need not have courage: just Valiance` (<a href="https://wiki.spiralknights.com/Valiance" target="_blank">Valiance</a>) - a stretch, but it has similarity to Justice of Almire: `Law and Order have fled Almire. Only Justice remains, but she too has been twisted by the cursed flames that ravage our kingdom. Justice is now the burning scepter of our once great Lord Vanaduke. Justice is swift, unflinching, merciless` (<a href="https://wiki.spiralknights.com/Legion_of_Almire/Inner_Sanctum" target="_blank">Legion of Almire/Inner Sanctum - Almirian codex</a>) in terms of how those concepts are referred.
- Cradle has much present spiral imagery, mentioned in the [Spiral section](#concept-of-spiral), it could be an appropriate location thematically for Knights to be related.
- The <a href="https://wiki.spiralknights.com/Hazardous_Prize_Box" target="_blank">Hazardous Prize Box</a> contains items relating to Scarlet Scouts:
  - `this helm is in the visage of a demon said to have broken off its own horn to use as a weapon when it faced its end.` <a href="https://wiki.spiralknights.com/Hazardous_Diablo_Helm#Hazardous_Diablo_Helm" target="_blank">Hazardous Diablo Helm</a> - a cultural presence of demons.
  - `this helm is in the visage of Death itself. Those that wear it have a saying, 'Death is at your heels, so keep facing forward'` (<a href="https://wiki.spiralknights.com/Hazardous_Grim_Mask#Hazardous_Grim_Mask" target="_blank">Hazardous Grim Mask</a>), - a personification of Death.
  - `this helm is in the visage of a fiend who lives in the mountains of a distant land. Said to guard the gate to heaven itself, it only allows those who are worthy to pass` (<a href="https://wiki.spiralknights.com/Hazardous_Oni_Helm#Hazardous_Oni_Helm" target="_blank">Hazardous Oni Helm</a>) - a cultural reference of Oni inhabiting mountains in Japanese folklore, and associated with thunder, which is present here as Storm-themed gear of the <a href="https://wiki.spiralknights.com/Stormy_Prize_Box" target="_blank">Stormy Prize Box</a>.
- Among auras, the <a href="https://wiki.spiralknights.com/Orbit_Aura#Orbit_Aura" target="_blank">Orbit aura</a> has Cradle's Sun and Moon present, held by clock-like mechanism, in construction similar materials used in the <a href="https://wiki.spiralknights.com/Celestial_Saber" target="_blank">Celestial Saber</a>.

  Yet, it has imagery of Cradle's Sun and Moon, - this is _likely an asset reuse_, but we are not confident of that due to presence of the same imagery on the <a href="https://wiki.spiralknights.com/Celestial_Shield" target="_blank">Celestial Shield</a> - due to how the theme of equinox is related through Strangers to Cradle (`The Strangers pause at the equinox to recognize the brief moment of cosmic balance on Cradle. For just a breath of time, there is harmony between night and day, the sun and moon, and symmetry in the celestial sphere` - [Balance of the Equinox!](https://forums.spiralknights.com/en/node/98178)), and seemingly to Isorian culture (`To recognize this special event, Spiral HQ has created new costumes and accessories for the Knights of the Spiral Order. ..., and meditate on the workings of the universe. Then, refreshed, delve back into the clockworks with equipment that is out of this world!` - [Balance of the Equinox!](https://forums.spiralknights.com/en/node/98178)), despite located far from Isora.

Considering Isorians' advancements of interstellar travel, taken Skylark designs or designs of celestial cosmetics, they must have a homeworld or a place of origin advanced enough to, at least, allow traveling to planet's orbit. Based on descriptions of celestial sets, Isora is implied to be that homeworld, rather than our earlier suggestion of it being related to Cradle's past.

##### Similarity to Heavenly Kingdom

Another point of discussion, if the Knights were at some point on Cradle, - is the conditions of their arrival on Cradle or a separate planet which was taken up by the Core. Were Knights present at the time of [the War of Heavenly Kingdom](#war-of-dragons-and-valkyries)?

There are some parallels of Spiral Knights gear and warriors of Heavenly Kingdom:

- Presence of <a href="https://wiki.spiralknights.com/Sun_Silver" target="_blank">Sun Silver</a>, used in Almire-related gear and Azure Guardian Armor.
  - Application in <a href="https://wiki.spiralknights.com/Azure_Guardian_Armor" target="_blank">Azure Guardian Armor</a> and <a href="https://wiki.spiralknights.com/Valkyrie_Mail" target="_blank">Valkyrie Armor</a>.
  - Revisiting <a href="https://wiki.spiralknights.com/Aegis" target="_blank">Aegis</a> and <a href="https://wiki.spiralknights.com/Crest_of_Almire" target="_blank">Crest of Almire</a> shields. If Isorians were in fact ancestors of Almire, Crest of Almire then can be justified to be made in an image of Aegis as the latter is made by the Spiral Order: `Whether its crest is a relic from the Order of old or a creation from the Knights' time on Cradle is not immediately clear` (<a href="https://wiki.spiralknights.com/Aegis" target="_blank">Aegis</a>), but Spiral Order's instance of Crest of Almire is the most prominent [redesign](#technology-alchemy-and-isorian-redesigns), specifically one that follows Aegis, but with the introduction of shadow defense in place of piercing.
  - Avenger line of swords ending with <a href="https://wiki.spiralknights.com/Divine_Avenger" target="_blank">Divine Avenger</a> which might belong to <a href="https://wiki.spiralknights.com/Heavenly_Guardian_Armor" target="_blank">Heavenly set</a>, but most certainly comes from a different time and place, where curse was found and reversed, as seen in the swords design, - that is heavenly kingdom with knowledge of seals and evil eye imagery, as it will be discussed later in the [Legion of Ur section](#legion-of-ur).

Although this fact is presented only now, the history of valkyries being that civilization of heavenly kingdom seems to more thematically fitting, which would not fit to more militarized, less related to mythology, less fantasy-themed, Spiral Order, even in its earlier state before it took name of a Spiral Order.

This suggestion would then lead us to the prior idea of **gear of other civilizations being adapted to anatomy of Isorians through mastered application of alchemy**.

This would also mean, that there are 2 emerging scenarios:

1. Knights of old order arrived at Cradle and there their conceived armors and gear utilizing Sun Silver present there. Yet, for now we can't offer a solid foundation for the difference of technological advancement before and after this suggested event.

   In that regard we are yet to justify more fantasy-themed weapons, such as <a href="https://wiki.spiralknights.com/Troika#Alchemy_Path" target="_blank">Troka 5-star upgrades</a> and the <a href="https://wiki.spiralknights.com/Cold_Iron_Vanquisher" target="_blank">Cold Iron Vanquisher</a> line of Calibur, making it similar to <a href="https://wiki.spiralknights.com/Almirian_Crusader_Armor" target="_blank">Almirian Crusader Armor</a> from the _design of alchemy tree progression_.

2. Dragons and Sun Silver would be universal to material realm, dragons were of different, primordial element, as it was earlier discussed, which would give them an unprecedented power nearing the gods. Although not associated with the gods in heavenly kingdom referred in <a href="https://wiki.spiralknights.com/Rider_Mantle" target="_blank">rider mantles</a>, unless the it was of dragons, then this would raise an anachronism.

##### Lack of Damage Types

One important aspect to address - if Isorians are as old as Heavenly Kingdom and aware of it, they would likely know of Shadow and Elemental damage, but this did not happen, evident by:

- `An exceptional handgun that fires powerful, elemental shots that many Spiral Knights refer to as 'magic missiles'` <a href="https://wiki.spiralknights.com/Arcana" target="_blank">Arcana</a> - elemental damage being referred to as magic.
- In Hall of Heroes, <a href="https://wiki.spiralknights.com/Archilus" target="_blank">Archilus</a> tells that Owlites likely discovered elemental damage an it was adapted by the Spiral Order, so it was known technology, but not one used across entirety of the Order: `Elemental resistant armor and shields are adapted from Owlite technology. Though the Owlites themselves no longer exist, their amazing elemental mastery lives on in this gear`.
- `Phantamos represents one of the most recent additions to the Spiral Knight's arsenal, as containing shadow energy of this degree took a great deal of research` <a href="https://wiki.spiralknights.com/Phantamos" target="_blank">Phantamos</a> - shadow damage was discovered on Cradle or very recently, before Skylark was launched.
- <a href="https://wiki.spiralknights.com/Riftlocker" target="_blank">Riftlocker</a> and <a href="https://wiki.spiralknights.com/Valiance" target="_blank">Valiance</a> on the other hand had already existed even during war at Morai.
- <a href="https://wiki.spiralknights.com/Celestial_Vortex" target="_blank">Celestial Vortex</a> and <a href="https://wiki.spiralknights.com/Arcana" target="_blank">Arcana</a> are a few instances of elemental damage in Spiral Order's history.
- Earlier mentioned <a href="https://wiki.spiralknights.com/Celestial_Shield" target="_blank">Celestial Shield</a> being one of a few shields combining shadow damage and piercing defenses. Herein shadow damage is associated with cold - `Cradle's equinox inspired the dual nature of this specialist shield, which protects against the dazzling light of day and the chill of the night in equal measure` (<a href="https://wiki.spiralknights.com/Celestial_Shield" target="_blank">Celestial Shield</a>), - similar to <a href="https://wiki.spiralknights.com/Winter_Grave" target="_blank">Winter Grave</a> and <a href="https://wiki.spiralknights.com/Permafroster" target="_blank">Permafroster</a>.

This would mean that <a href="https://wiki.spiralknights.com/Sun_silver" target="_blank">Sun Silver</a> - `An extraordinary metal imbued with the radiant light of the sky`, is ever-present as Shadow Steel. Here we also propose, that the <a href="https://wiki.spiralknights.com/Celestial_Ore" target="_blank">Celestial Ore</a>, through its relation to heavens, we suggest it preceding Sun Silver, as yet unrefined ore becoming metal.

Moreover as heavens are refered to as a seemingly different realm, although given the mythological motifs, it can be related to a physical or metaphysical location of an unknown third realm: `An extremely rare metal of great power said to be from the heavens above` (<a href="https://wiki.spiralknights.com/Celestial_Ore" target="_blank">Celestial Ore</a>). The celestial naming scheme was repeated at least twice - in relation to Isorians and Valkyries.

Although addressed earlier, - if Spiral Order did arrive or emerge on Cradle, Cradle or composing it planets must have had to be far more advanced, at least same as the devices/gear of the implied celestials.

Ancient structures are preserved, as proven by presence of Scarlet Fortress and Tortodrones. The lack of knowledge of Spiral HQ's side on the shadow and elemental damage, as if it is was only present on Cradle in most powerful form, would suggest that the supposed dragons did not have those powers outside of related to the creation myth dragons.

By presence of primordial dragons Isorians would discover shadow and elemental damage on their own far in the past. As for Spiral Order to extract their scales for the Azure Guardian Armor, someone had to be present.

A suggestion we would propose here, is that only one family of dragons was present on Isora - such as dragons of rage as ones most related to normal damage, and not associated with frenzy/shadow nor divinity/storms/elemental damage.

Based on that knowledge, we lean to a conclusion of Isorians being an extraterrestrial to Cradle species. Cradle does not have technology more advanced than of Almire or of gremlins found on Cradle, apart from the event of the <a href="https://wiki.spiralknights.com/Ghosts_in_the_Machine" target="_blank">Iron Hulk</a>. Cradle is not Isorian homeworld, but its inhabitants have similar myths to Isorian culture.

And, relating back to dragons, on Isora there were dragons of rage, demons within mountains, mythical personifications of Death.

From Isora interstellar expansion of Isorians began, at some point arriving to Cradle, as seen in case of the <a href="https://wiki.spiralknights.com/Ghosts_in_the_Machine" target="_blank">Iron Hulk</a>. If celestial gear is considered, the technology of those times was advanced enough to allow existence of starships, similar to Skylark.

#### Morai Wars

It is unknown for how long Morai Wars have already lasted, but it is known that during Skylark expedition it was not only ongoing, but severely crippling for Isorians. Several members of the Skylark crew had fought there, for example Euclid of the Alpha Squad - `Euclid wasn't your typical knight. By the time most in his division were getting their Squire crest, he had already achieved Vanguard. As a Squad Leader, he lead a series of successful assaults against the Morai during the liberation of Isora. A brilliant tactician, he was known for getting the job done with half the knights of other squads` (<a href="https://wiki.spiralknights.com/The_Pioneers#Dialogue" target="_blank">The Pioneers</a>).

Current proposal, one that we derive from the discussion on the identity of Morai, is of another star system, containing planet or colony of Morai, is colonized by Isorians. But, this colony should not be too far for them to seige Isora: `These firearms proved instrumental during the siege of Isora in breaking through the war machines of the Morai` (<a href="https://wiki.spiralknights.com/Riftlocker" target="_blank">Riftlocker</a>). The idea of Morai being located in a different star system can be affirmed both by [Skylark's](#skylark) identified **usage of tearium to open spacial tunnels to travel long distances**, and previusly covered themes and descriptions of individual items found in the <a href="https://wiki.spiralknights.com/Equinox_Prize_Box" target="_blank">Equinox Prize Box</a>.

Isora was sieged by Morai, which is a possible reason behind lack of energy, as Morai in that position would have virtually all planetary surface and infrastructure covered.

The total lack of energy in this war was a reason behind Skylark expedition for another energy source. This would suggest that the homeworld of Isora could not provide that energy, and capable enough, likely after the siege of Isora, to at least launch those ships.

##### Celestial Bomb

Another suggestion, one that seems plausible in a setting of artificial planets with Cores of near-limitless energy, is based on the <a href="https://wiki.spiralknights.com/Celestial_Vortex" target="_blank">Celestial Vortex</a>: `A Celestial Bomb modified with a payload of a dying sun`. If this is not considered a metaphor, then Isorians had to counter death of a star. And, considering bomb's usage and naming of a vortex, being similar to <a href="https://wiki.spiralknights.com/Graviton_Vortex" target="_blank">Graviton</a> and <a href="https://wiki.spiralknights.com/Electron_Vortex" target="_blank">Electron</a> vortexes, the result of the celestial vortex specifically could be related to a phenomenon of black holes or, in the context of graviton nature of the setting, a different method of opening up different realms. In case of graviton, it will be Underworld, as we will cover graviton technology in [its according section](#undercorps-graviton-technology).

This could render Isorian system potentially uninhabitable, but also give more context for the <a href="https://wiki.spiralknights.com/Stellar_Sentinel_Suit" target="_blank">Stellar Sentinel Suit</a> due to its description: `With this equipped, you feel like you could dive into the heart of a star`.

Th eability to create bombs of this magnitude would also give a better understanding of Morai military power, as thay are compared to Isorians, and framed as the gretaest to date danger: `Euclid wasn't your typical knight. By the time most in his division were getting their Squire crest, he had already achieved Vanguard. As a Squad Leader, he lead a series of successful assaults against the Morai during the liberation of Isora. A brilliant tactician, he was known for getting the job done with half the knights of the other squads. ... After all, if you cut your teeth battling under Morai fire you could probably handle anything right? But maybe the Clockworks proved too much for even his ability` (<a href="https://wiki.spiralknights.com/The_Pioneers" target="_blank">The Pioneers - Kora</a>). It is known that Euclid survived: `Euclid volunteered to help The Sleeper. I'm sure he's in here somewhere battling The Swarm even as we speak` (<a href="https://wiki.spiralknights.com/Refuge" target="_blank">Dreams and Nightmares - Refuge - Parma's Scout</a>).

And yet, the reasons for Morai war to errupt, remain unknown.

In the context of Morai and Isorians one thing in particular is left, a context of the <a href="https://wiki.spiralknights.com/Ghosts_in_the_Machine" target="_blank">Ghost in the Machine</a> danger mission and technology of battlepods.

##### Ghosts in the Machine

Depth of <a href="https://wiki.spiralknights.com/Iron_Hulk" target="_blank">Iron Hulk</a> is located in the <a href="https://wiki.spiralknights.com/Ghosts_in_the_Machine/Dry_Dock" target="_blank">dry docks</a> of the Clockworks. Dry docks are build in similar manner as Clockwork tunnels and deconstruction zones, both of which are constructed by gremlins and contained within a skydome, as long as this design is diegetic and not an asset reuse, which we have to keep in mind before building any theories.

In that context, paired with the <a href="https://wiki.spiralknights.com/Cargo_Bay" target="_blank">cargo bay</a> and bridge-like room at the end of iron hulk behind the Big Iron battlepod, _we can identify the entire structure as a spacefaring vessel_. Moreover, uniform of pilots on the bridge is extremely similar to Isorian armors, such as <a href="https://wiki.spiralknights.com/Stellar_Sentinel_Suit" target="_blank">Stellar Sentinel Suit</a>, which may prove that the spacecraft belong to Isorian or even Morai.

Why would this ship be on Cradle? To explain this, we introduce a following possible scenario.

From both warring sides starships are sent to search an energy source to assist at war: from Isora Skylark was sent, from Morai, on the other hand, a candidate can be presented in a form of ship which became the <a href="https://wiki.spiralknights.com/Iron_Hulk" target="_blank">Iron Hulk</a>. Far earlier, depending on Skylark physics. As we have concluded that [Skylark](#skylark) can seemingly travel large distances utilizing a technology, allowing for creating tunnels, we can suggest, that this vessel was launched far earlier in the past.

Iron Hulk, for lack of a better term, either crash-landed or was captured on Cradle, as there are <a href="https://wiki.spiralknights.com/Ghosts_in_the_Machine/Dry_Dock" target="_blank">dry docks</a> within which the vessel is placed. Weather dry docks were constructed for the ship, while it was transported at lower depths, or the ship safely arrived there, is unknown.

Considering sheer amounts of resources required to build Clockworks, the ship and its layout had remained mostly untouched, but rather sealed in the docks, with the cargo bay remaining as it was, the fact that it remained may point to a fact that it was a risky operation to salvage it. There are constructs surrounding the ship, which are of gremlin origin, as well presence of souls and undead, including undead <a href="https://wiki.spiralknights.com/Static_Deadnaught" target="_blank">Dreadnaughts</a>.

The only reason why gremlins had to contain it and not disassemble, is likely due to a greater risk, one introduced by the souls and gremlin vulnerability to shadow damage of undead, which are likely the crew influenced by the same phenomenon observed in the rest of the Clockworks and graveyards. As it was explored in the [graveyards section](#graveyards), zombies are seem to be undead Almirians.

This would mean that Isorians are also capable of being transformed into the undead after initial death, as explored in the [corporeal body section](#corporeal-body).

Then there is the crew at vessel's bridge. Their position indicated that the death was either sudden, or that they were already dead when the ship arrived to Cradle's surface, and that could be a reason behind haunting, as the undeath of Cradle is not seen by the Spiral Order anywhere else.

Yet, no other place apart from Cradle has the tendency of undead and spirits returning, meaning that the haunting had to happen on Cradle or in its proximity (`Why spirits return to the material realm is unknown` - <a href="https://wiki.spiralknights.com/Weight_of_Darkness" target="_blank">Weight of Darkness</a>). This would not explain presence of <a href="https://wiki.spiralknights.com/Static_Soul#Static_Soul" target="_blank">static souls</a>, as the presence of souls on itself is a phenomenon, which, yet again, requires analysis of Cradle itself.

And then there is a battlepod - <a href="https://wiki.spiralknights.com/The_Big_Iron#The_Big_Iron" target="_blank">Big Iron</a>. Gremlins utilize battlepods in many instances, including rank missions. Presence of a unique battlepod within Isorian vessel is unconventional. Moreover, there are wires and cables connecting entire place. While they could be explained by the fact that this is an interstellar vessel, does not explain battlepod itself, as well as it being seemingly a focal point of spirits in control of the place, or their final line of defenses, as suggested by the quote:

`Do not hold back` / `WE WILL NOT HOLD BACK.`

This quote differs from the most, as it is the one of two instances of so called machine referencing itself, the other one is:

`They will kill us they will kill you.` / `THEY WILL KILL US THEY WILL KILL YOU.`

Here, as by missions name, inspiration must be sought in the 1993 film of the same name. The synopsis is that the soul of a serial killer is transferred to digital space of a computer network and electrical grid due to faulted MRI scan during electrical storm, which allowed him to continues his killings from the electrical grid and computer network. In the end, he was defeated through an introduction of a computer virus, which trapped him within a network segment and then through application of extreme magnetic field, killed him.

We can attempt to draw parallels with the events on Cradle in regards to the ship.

The entrapment part seems to be something implied by the presence of gremlin constructs. And to go not so far ahead of the timeline, this is one of a few instances of gremlins building their own containments against the shadow-related entities.

This would also suggest that some event might have caused this haunting. From many things related to undeath, energy of the Core could serve as a device which had caused the spirits to haunt the machines under some currently unknown conditions. Although we will cover the influence of Undercorp and Underworld in further sections, in relation to this theory, we believe that a less occult-like and related to Underworld reason stands for this shift between life and death across material realm.

Considering all of it, the battlepod might be seen as a security measure installed by gremlins during earlier time with the case of cargo bay, either constructed prior or post-factum the vessel arriving.

In relation to gremlins, due to lack of any candidates, they are the ones referred to as "they" by the machine:

`THEY WILL KILL US THEY WILL KILL YOU.`

As it was established by the lowercase ghost quotes, their "they" is the machine itself. The machine referring to somebody else, other then themselves, should point to a presence of a third party. Based on a conclusion that the battlepod and constructs of the cargo bay may belong to gremlins, may suggest that machine's "they" refers to gremlins.

Presence of the crew on the bridge would not be explained by this. Although an earlier discussed scenario can be reintroduced here, that those members of the crew were dead during the landing of the ship, but then above quote would not fit here, as the gremlins would not be ones responsible in that case.

##### Battlepods and Laser Technology

Then there are lasers of Big Iron battlepod. Their amount indicates presence of the similar to Roarmulus Twins technology, which in the latter case is the laser cannons, most clearly seen at the end of <a href="https://wiki.spiralknights.com/Ironclaw_Munitions_Factory/Warfare_Workshop" target="_blank">Warfare Workshop of the Ironclaw Munitions Factory</a>. The same cannons are installed into the Roarmulus Twins. But in case of the battlepod, their place takes circular set of artilleries hidden within battlepod's hulk.

If the idea of this battlepod being manufactured by gremlins is true, this would mean that <a href="https://wiki.spiralknights.com/Ironclaw_Munitions_Factory" target="_blank">Ironclaw Munitions Factory</a> itself is also more that a hundred years old. Considering its dilapidated state, suggested both by internal design and naming such as its <a href="https://wiki.spiralknights.com/Ironclaw_Munitions_Factory/Abandoned_Assembly" target="_blank">Abandoned Assembly</a>, it is highly possible. In that notion, the state of gremlin clans is also not seen as particularly stable, even if gremlin nature taken in consideration:

- King Tinkinzar is absent: `Tinkinzar not seen for many many years. Crimson Order carries out Tinkinzar's plans for Cradle. Emberlight was blight on master plan because built by outcasts. Haven was probably the same, founded by non-Gremlins` (<a href="https://wiki.spiralknights.com/Pakrat#Dialogue" target="_blank">Pakrat</a>).
- [Instability](#gremlin-military-industrial-complex) within the Crimson Order and explicit and likely recent power shifts.
- Emberlight still remains and is home for outcasts of the Great Colony: `Emberlight founded by Gremlin outcasts from Great Colony. Gremlins of Emberlight not obey the Iron Law, so flee or die. We start over with Emberlight. New colony home to few of us: most ex-schemers, some merchants, some fighters, all traitors in the eyes of Great Colony Gremlins` (<a href="https://wiki.spiralknights.com/Pakrat#Dialogue" target="_blank">Pakrat</a>).
- Cradle's defenses are not controlled by gremlins directly, as implied by the quote: `Once, the gremlins were in charge of maintaining Cradle's defenses. But they had their own plans` (<a href="https://wiki.spiralknights.com/Refuge" target="_blank">Dreams and Nightmares - Refuge - Parma's Scout</a>), but as Skylark was shot down, we will return to the nature of those defenses in the [analysis of gremlins](#gremlin-empire).

Now, as for the **identity of the ship, we propose that it belongs to species of Isora**. Then it can be attributed to either Morai or Isorians, and as we suggest, it being the prior, mainly due to the fact that we know of them very little, and at the same time Spiral Order would have known of its interstellar vessel disappearing or at least be capable of identifying it though prominence of the Spiral Order insignia of a Spiral Warden. This emblem is not present in the Iron Hulk. On the other hand, thare are cases of Raiders and kingdom of Almire being completely ignored or recognized as bearing or invoking any similarity to Isorians from their perspective.

<h3 align="center">Chapter <code>VI</code>: Arrival of Undercorp</h3>

Tortomega, the [titans](#chapter-titans), descendants of tortoises and far descendants of dragons, were pressed back into the wildwoods after a [war with valkyries of heavenly kingdom](#fiendisj-statues). Presence of a war taking place we proposed in the [analysis of decorated fiendish statues](#fiendish-statues) in the halls of several castle structures in Clockworks.

This conclusion we made based on the similarity of tortomega as a supposed civilization behind the prevalent ruins, and valkyries, as they both have significant element, attributed to norse mythology, specifically of Jotun, the giants, and valkyries and gods of Asgard, partially inspired by their relationship from the myths.

In the scenarios of titans being at war with valkyries or only assisting them in the construction of the castles, in [chapter 3](#ancient-titans) we concluded, that Gloaming Wildwoods and <a href="https://wiki.spiralknights.com/Ancient_Grove" target="_blank">Ancient Grove</a> had to belong to titans' territory. And, due to a hypothesized location of [veiled homeland](#veiled-homeland), we proposed that Gloaming Wildwoods are not the birthplace of titans, with homeland referring to a location which, through the analysis of strata of ruins, fractured into <a href="https://wiki.spiralknights.com/Aurora_Isles" target="_blank">Aurora Isles</a>, <a href="https://wiki.spiralknights.com/Jigsaw_Valley" target="_blank">Jigsaw Valley</a>, <a href="https://wiki.spiralknights.com/Wolver_Den" target="_blank">Wolver Dens</a>, and <a href="https://wiki.spiralknights.com/Starlight_Cradle" target="_blank">Starlight Cradle</a>.

As tortodrones are most recent physically present lead to understanding Tortomega, we will start this analysis from what was found during the long migration of tortodrones, specifically, in the <a href="https://wiki.spiralknights.com/Ancient_Grove" target="_blank">Ancient Grove</a>.

The connection between fiends of Undercorp and tortodrones is posed almost instantly, as to encounter working tortodrones, albeit in a corrupted state, Spiral Knights need to collect <a href="https://wiki.spiralknights.com/Fiendish_ID_Card#Recipe" target="_blank">fiendish glyphs</a> and make an <a href="https://wiki.spiralknights.com/Fiendish_ID_Card" target="_blank">identification card</a> in order to gain access to the depths of Ancient Grove, wherein tortodrones are located, <a href="https://wiki.spiralknights.com/Call_of_the_Colossi" target="_blank">Call of the Colossi</a>. Spiral HQ suggests that `the Fiends are somehow linked to the disappearance of those once-mythical beings` ([March of the Tortodrones](<https://wiki.spiralknights.com/March_of_the_Tortodrones_(Mission)>)).

#### Ritual Circles, Circle of Art, Pentacles

We will start from a particular ritual circle around inactive tortodrone near the elevator at the end of <a href="https://wiki.spiralknights.com/Call_of_the_Colossi" target="_blank">Call of the Colossi</a> beyond the grim gates located in the <a href="https://wiki.spiralknights.com/Ancient_Grove" target="_blank">Ancient Grove</a>.

This circle has all of the same fiendish sigils, used occasionally across Clockworks in locations containing mineral pillars. Currently we will not analyze nature of those rooms in Clockwork tunnels. Circle of the same color, - pale white, - but smaller and without fiendish sigils can be found before the Call of The Colossi arena, surrounding inactive tortodrone part.

Based on the notion of fiends having in possession working but corrupted tortodrones, we can suggest, although it is a speculation currently, that those circles of different color and currently unknown mineral seem to possess a warding property, protecting the encircled entity. In our case, of an inactive tortodrone and its parts. We will revisit this speculation of the warding motif, developing it further, as we analyze the imagery of devilite ritual circles.

The identification of those tortodrones as ones being corrupted stems from the differences in the design, compared both to regular tortodrones found marching in the end of Call of the Colossi, and an enraged tortodrone depicted at mission's card. The corruption is visible mainly by presence of _purple color_, likely of dark matter, _cracked arms_, _stitched shells_, and _carved sigils on shell's plates in place of eyes_.

Fiendish ritual circles are purple, same as dark matter mineral, the circles found in the Call of the Colossi are ghostly white. This practice of using different color is observed at the <a href="https://wiki.spiralknights.com/Everfrost_Tower" target="_blank">Everfrost Tower</a>, in a <a href="https://wiki.spiralknights.com/File:Konjuring_Kat-Overworld.png" target="_blank">ritual circle in the Moorcroft Manor</a>, and during <a href="https://wiki.spiralknights.com/File:SotA-Gameplay_End.png" target="_blank">Departure of Shroud of Apocrea</a>. Due to consistency of dark matter color, we can conclude that dark matter is not used in the latter instances, as they are not purple. Currently we won't consider different physics of the ritual circles depending on their mineral, but, it is important to note, that _there exists an aspect of minerals capable of being charged, which results, as we will soon see, in their color shifting_.

The sigils themselves, including ritual circles, seem to be inspired by the composition of Solomon seals or the pentacles from "The Kay of Solomon the King", and pinpointed to a few patterns, as suggested by <a href="https://forums.spiralknights.com/en/node/7857#comment-40758" target="_blank">Kentngo on Spiral Knights forums</a>: `The Fifth Pentacle of Saturn combined with the meaning of the Seventh Pentacle of the Sun. Two circles, denoting the angels names between the two. The center shows a resemblance to the Third Pentacle of Mercury. Although the angelic names are gibberish in this case`.

<BookCitation source="The Key of Solomon the King">

`The Fifth Pentacle of Saturn. This Pentacle defendeth those who invoke the Spirits of Saturn during the night and chaseth away the Spirits which guard treasures` [p.60, fig.15].

---

`The Seventh and Last Pentacle of the Sun. If any be by chance imprisoned or detained in fetters of iron, at the presence of this Pentacle, which should be engraved in Gold on the day and hour of the Sun, he will be immediately delivered and set at liberty` [p.66, fig.38].

---

`The Third Pentacle of Mercury. This and the following serve to invoke the Spirits subject unto Mercury and especially those who are written in this Pentacle` [p.68, fig.46].

</BookCitation>

The idea of protection for dark matter circles is a novel one, but it follows along the previous concept of pale white circles as warding ones. The protected target is the one encircled - in case of devilites, or, likely gremlins, those are mineral pillars.

Then, through this logic, the pale circles indeed belong to a different party, as they had used a different mineral for those circles.

We suggest, that while the protection aspect persists, the later instances of ritual circles, ones relating to everfrost, and others to inner establishment of the Moorcroft Manor, demonstrate other abilities of the circles, namely capacity to summon - we will cover this in detail. So far, we are noting here, that __those circles are not drawn by fiends, but the consistent practice itself has to emerge from some culture, which we consider so far being from the Underworld__.

Previously mentioned idea of white circles serving as a ward, seems more plausible under those interpretations of protection. Moreover, the concept of the circle itself is introduced in "The Key of Solomon the King" and is called the _Circle of Art_:

<BookCitation source="The Key of King Solomon the King">

`Verily, since no experiments for converse with Spirits can be done without shouldest wish to prepared, whatsoever experiments therefore thou wishest to undertake for conversing with Spirits, therein thou must learn to construct a certain particular Circle that being done surround that Circle with a Circle of Art for better caution and efficacy. [Book 1, ch. II, "Of the Days, and Hours, and of the Virtues of the Planets."]`

---

`The which being finished, and the fumigations being performed, as is described in the chapter on Fumigations in the Second Book, the Master should reassemble his Disciples, encourage them, reassure them, fortify them, and conduct them into the parts of the Circle of Art, where he must place them in the four quarters of the earth, encourage them, and exhort them to fear nothing, and to keep in the places assigned to them. [Book 1, ch. III, "The Construction of the Circle"]`

---

`The Medals or Pentacles, which we make for the purpose ot striking terror into the Spirits and reducing them to obedience, have besides this wonderful and excellent virtue. If thou invokest the Spirits by virtue of these Pentacles, they will obey thee without repugnance, and having considered them they will be struck with astonishment, and will fear them, and thou shalt see them so surprised by fear and terror, that none of them will be sufficiently bold to wish to oppose thy will. [Book 1, ch. XVIII, "Concerning the Holy Pentacles or Medals."]`

</BookCitation>

It is due to those similarities and general themes found in the Key, we propose, that fiendish symbols in the circles are derived from the shapes of symbols not of of the "Alphabet of Magic" as present in the Key, which itself is derived from Hebrew alphabet in "The Key of Solomon the King", but from Old Hebrew alphabet, or even Phoenician alphabet.

This distinction, we believe, stems from the fact fiends had carved a final, nowhere else seen sigil on corrupted tortodrones' back of the shell along with other common sigils - letter Teth "𐤈", which also was at the foundation of letter Theta "Θ" of Greek alphabet, which, on par with our [suggestion](#technology-alchemy-and-isorian-redesigns) of symbol of Salt - "🜔", - could be a prototype for the symbol of energy, although one only in the design, rather than meaning, if we are to integrate this idea into the setting. By that we mean, that the possibility of several inspirations was already seen in prior chapters, so for energy to possess same motif of using multiple sources is not out of the established pattern so far.

##### Summoning from Underworld

Apart from those implied properties, which might help in establishing overall theme, there is one important element to ritual circles. Ritual circles can summon entities from locations beyond material realm.

There are 2 instances of such application of ritual circles is seen across Clockworks.

During the events of <a href="https://wiki.spiralknights.com/The_Return_of_Ur" target="_blank">return of the Legion of Ur</a>, devilites utilized ritual circles to summon banished to the Underworld trojans: `devilites are attempting to summon a legion of powerful trojan warriors. Based on intel from a devilite internal memo, the trojans are known as the 'Legion or Ur' ... the memo indicated that the Legion of Ur was sealed away in the Underworld and that an alternative approach would be required for bringing them back` (<a href="https://wiki.spiralknights.com/The_Return_of_Ur" target="_blank">The Return of Ur</a>).

Here the alternative approach devilites had spoken of, is implied to be used during mission's events, that of ritual circles. Then this must mean, that an original approach should exist. Notably, from the same memo it is likely that whatever original approach was, it does not work for sealed in Underworld entities.

We believe that the original approach implied to exist, is the technology of grim gates. Considering that devilites use the ritual circle method on Cradle, and are considered stranded (`data collected from fiendish cities seems to indicate that they are now stranded on Cradle, much like us` - <a href="https://wiki.spiralknights.com/Weight_of_Darkness" target="_blank">Weight of Darkness</a>), then there should be a reason why they did not use the gates, as it is the only other technology directly related to devilites.

The underlying grim gates technology, paired with relation to tortodrones is one of, if not the first, instances of Underworld presenting itself to known material realm.

For trojans, the solution was to utilize known sigils and draw ritual circles, pulling trojans from Underworld, as implied by depths' names and internal design:

- Depth of <a href="https://wiki.spiralknights.com/Dark_City/Plazamonium" target="_blank">Plazamonium</a> is referred in the <a href="https://wiki.spiralknights.com/The_Return_of_Ur" target="_blank">mission</a> as the `Summoning Circle` (<a href="https://wiki.spiralknights.com/The_Return_of_Ur" target="_blank">The Return of Ur</a>).
- In that context `Dimensional Shift` (<a href="https://wiki.spiralknights.com/The_Return_of_Ur" target="_blank">The Return of Ur</a>) may be identified as an area of dark cities surrounding the ritual site, and it is affected by something.
- A specific <a href="https://wiki.spiralknights.com/File:Scenario_Room-DevilishDrudgery_1.png" target="_blank">scenario room</a> has a particularly large ritual site composed of 6 smaller ritual circles.

  The information module near the site states: `5 Ways to Appease your Pit Boss` (<a href="https://wiki.spiralknights.com/Scenario_room" target="_blank">Scenario Room</a>), this might reveal more about internal corporate structure of Undercorp - that of unfamiliar utilized as mundane, - the _urban, corporate setting of devilites' dark cities is combined with the theme of mundane occult_.

To affirm potential role as a summoning mechanism, connecting Underworld and material realm, there is one single direct evidence of those rituals circles seen as capable of bringing entities to material realm. Although there is a notion of ritual circles utilizing different minerals, we won't currently consider it in order to emphasize the patterns themselves, connected to devilites, yet minerals may play a role in the exact laws of rituals.

In the Moorcroft Manor, black kat Margrel of the Kat tribe is summoned through the process of applying incantation from the <a href="https://wiki.spiralknights.com/Book_of_Dark_Rituals" target="_blank">Book of Dark Rituals</a> to the <a href="https://wiki.spiralknights.com/File:Konjuring_Kat-Overworld.png" target="_blank">ritual circle</a>.

Margrel summoning is characterized by a formation of a dark-pink maelstrom enveloping the space below the manor. The maelstrom itself is extremely similar to one later observed across the grim gates, once [their open portal is destroyed at the end of devilite onslaught, with a blue-purple core](#grim-gtes-portal-collapse). We will look into the grim gates, as technology, soon enough. But, as of currently, it seems likely that in general, by the pattern of the ritual circle itself, entities can be brought in, and combined with the analysis of grim gates, the location in question is the Underworld.

A particularly large logical leap we had to take here, but one proposing a solution of how devilites entered material realm, is that tortomega being the ones who summoned devilites originally to a planet preceding Cradle though application of similar magic to one used with fiendish ritual circles, or by actions of Undercorp itself. In this proposal we consider white circles being devised after devilites' arrival, as the sigils do seem to belong to fiends.

The reasoning behind those 2 ideas of devilites arriving in proximity of the titans will be covered throughout the proposal itself, as we delve into specifics, but the gist of it is based around 2 major elements: [tortdrones' design containing "the eyes](#construction-of-tortodrones) and [existence of Snarbolax](#snarbolax), with an addition of Shadow Gloaming Wildwoods' [miasma](#miasma). The miasma exists largely on its own, and will be covered in the [analysis of Shadow Lairs](#analysis-of-shadow-lairs).

Considering that the dragons were a unique species in our thought framework, discovery of Underworld through their means, - through relation to dragons and inheritance of their abilities, - in case of tortomega, of potentially rage or frenzy. The latter could be the case, if we take [fiendish statues'](#fiendish-statues) depiction of tortomega as-is, rather than an interpretation, due to their design reminiscent of devilites.

If titans did uncover Underworld, likely a more rudimentary approach of _ritual circles_ was used, but so far, apart from white warding circles, there are no evidence of such action. The mention of a war with valkyries in the beginning in this context could be interpreted as a precedent for titans' research, or, Underworld would itself make appearance without major actions from titans.

#### Undercorp's Initial Advancements

With Underworld uncovered, devilites and Undercorp arrived with <a href="https://wiki.spiralknights.com/Greaver" target="_blank">Greavers</a>. Greavers will be important at explaining further presence of the eye symbolism in relation to curse at the [evil eye section](#evil-eye).

Likely, combined efforts of Undercorp and tortomega allowed for a cooperation. During this period of time several technologies were either developed or introduced to material realm:

- Invention of <a href="https://wiki.spiralknights.com/Graviton_Bomb" target="_blank">Graviton Bomb and Graviton Vortex</a>. Despite tortomega likely aware of power of frenzy or shadow, we think that the bomb was created after the arrival of devilites as it has an **ornament evil eye** present on it, uncharacteristic of _more simple design of the evil eye_ present of Greavers' helm. Bomb's design of the shell and its explosion's sigil has the same _ornament evil eye depicted_.
- Being similar to graviton bomb it its design - <a href="https://wiki.spiralknights.com/File:Exploration-Vortex_Block.png" target="_blank">Vortex Block</a> seems to use the same gravity-related principles, contains a dark pulsating core, as it is present in those arenas. The diegesis of explosive blocks is also important, which we will [cover separately](#diegesis-of-explosive-blocks).
- Material, <a href="https://wiki.spiralknights.com/Vile_Seal" target="_blank">Vile seal</a> is utilized in alchemy of bombs and many shadow-related equipment. The seal itself is explicitly related by drop rate and description, to occult themes of Underworld: `A small scrap of ancient parchment imbued with dark magicks. It is believed that they grant power to those with evil souls`.

Weather grim gates were invented during this period of time is unknown, as they have strictly devilite imagery, compared to the rest of tech, which lacks it. As for the naming convention, there are also <a href="https://wiki.spiralknights.com/Totem#Grim_Totem" target="_blank">grim totems</a>, which revive zombies from their skulls. Considering it, there are a few other items relating to death or Underworld in some ways though the naming convention of "grim":

- `Designed to frighten their enemies, this helm is in the visage of Death itself` (<a href="https://wiki.spiralknights.com/Grim_Mask" target="_blank">Grim Mask</a>).
- <a href="https://wiki.spiralknights.com/Grim_Scarab#Grim_Scarab" target="_blank">Grim Scarabs</a> which have relation to undeath and spirits during the <a href="https://wiki.spiralknights.com/Dark_Harvest_Festival" target="_blank">Dark Harvest Festival</a>. We should keep in mind that Strangers are ones who celebrate this festival, and are aware of such entities as <a href="https://wiki.spiralknights.com/Phantom" target="_blank">Phantoms</a> of [Graveyard](#graveyards), <a href="https://wiki.spiralknights.com/Scarab" target="_blank">scarabs</a>, and <a href="https://wiki.spiralknights.com/Pumpkin_King" target="_blank">Pumpkin King</a>, as seen from the masks obtained from <a href="https://wiki.spiralknights.com/Maskwell" target="_blank">Maskwell</a>.
- `A small wisp of the essential spirit of darkness and decay` (<a href="https://wiki.spiralknights.com/Grim_Spark#Treasure_Box_Tokens" target="_blank">Grim Spark</a>)
- Although not related directly, <a href="https://wiki.spiralknights.com/Grim_Repeater" target="_blank">Grim Repeater</a>, as it is a shadow damage weapon.

Based on a few such instances, it is likely that at least Grim Totems and Grim Gates are of Undercorp development or Underworld in general.

#### Grim Gates

Finally, the <a href="https://wiki.spiralknights.com/March_of_the_Tortodrones/Call_of_the_Colossi" target="_blank">Grim Gates</a> were introduced to the material realm if not constructed in place, as means of large-scale transportation between Underworld and material realm with the base of operation in <a href="https://wiki.spiralknights.com/Call_of_the_Colossi" target="_blank">Call of The Colossi</a>.

__This entire depth is referred as the "staging area"__ in <a href="https://wiki.spiralknights.com/March_of_the_Tortodrones/Ancient_Grove" target="_blank">Morgral'm's memo</a>: `An ID Card is required to access the staging area. Properly presenting the ID Card will consume it to power the Grim Gate`, highly suggesting that this area had its own dedicated role for Undercorp's operations in material realm.

The term "staging area" is usually used in relation to logistics, construction, aviation and military, but all of them mean essentially the same - a point of arrival, departure, or transit, wherein preparations are made. We will keep this definition in mind.

The depth itself is locked behind <a href="https://wiki.spiralknights.com/Fiendish_ID_Card" target="_blank">Fiendish ID Card</a> and has large amount of gates, aligning well wth the above description. The area is connected to, likely, the Underworld, as seen by the _dark city interior with an opened portals in the gates_, with an inactive tortodrone in sight. This side of the gates will be visited shortly.

Grim Gates are powered by the glyphs, as those are used to create the <a href="https://wiki.spiralknights.com/Fiendish_ID_Card" target="_blank">card</a> and carried by fiends (<a href="https://wiki.spiralknights.com/Fiendish_ID_Card" target="_blank">Fiendish ID Card</a>, `An ID Card is required to access the staging area. Properly presenting the ID Card will consume it to power the Grim Gate` - <a href="https://wiki.spiralknights.com/Morgral%27m" target="_blank">Morgral'm</a>), sharing more information on the underlying principles of portals' physics.

##### Fiendish Glyphs

Naming convention of glyphs with their appearance may shed some light on the inspirations behind Underworld and devilites in general through recognition of a common motifs or themes. We will attempt to look at them as this may potentially result in some historical parallels in the in-universe development of Underworld.

There are 5 fiendish glyphs in total required to construct the identification card, which also functions as power source for the gates. This fact alone suggests that those glyphs have an internal power, similar to minerals, as they will be [discussed later](#minerals-and-souls-part-1).

Glyphs' icons in the inventory also provide more context for their nature. Here we apply a similar concept of the diegetic interface of the game, where materials are also fall under Spiral Order classification. In the inventory they are depicted as essences, or metaphysic elements, yet being identified as glyphs - characters in writing system. We establish this motif based on other instances of this inventory icon being used:

- `A powerful essence that left behind when a creature perishes during a blind, fiery rage` (<a href="https://wiki.spiralknights.com/Flame_Soul" target="_blank">Flame Soul</a>).
- `A rare elemental found hovering in storm clouds. Their electric hum creates an almost melodic choir that can be faintly heard between thunderclaps` (<a href="https://wiki.spiralknights.com/Storm_Chaser" target="_blank">Storm Chaser</a>). While it differs thematically from the rest, we must keep in mind, that its original name - of the material - was Spark of Life (`The old ‘Spark of Life’ crafting material has been renamed to 'Storm Chaser'` - [Release Notes: 2013.07.30](https://wiki.spiralknights.com/Release_Notes_2013-07-30)).
- `A powerful essence left behind when a creature perishes from a particularly putrid disease` (<a href="https://wiki.spiralknights.com/Plague_Essence" target="_blank">Plague Essence</a>).
- `A small patch of ice crystals that never seem to melt, even when exposed to direct heat` (<a href="https://wiki.spiralknights.com/Everfrost" target="_blank">Everfrost</a>).
- `A mote of burning energy salvaged from Lord Vanaduke's throne room. It slowly smolders with a sinister intensity, creating an almost hypnotic trance when gazed upon for any length of time` (<a href="https://wiki.spiralknights.com/Dark_Ember" target="_blank">Dark Ember</a>).

The glyphs have color, one that can be related to minerals, although currently this may be an attempt of fitting similarities:

- Name <a href="https://wiki.spiralknights.com/Fiendish_Amu_Glyph" target="_blank">Amu Glyph</a>, color pink, relation to crimsonite: `said to contain the passion, anger and strength of the life surrounding it`.
- Name <a href="https://wiki.spiralknights.com/Fiendish_Nok_Glyph" target="_blank">Nok Glyph</a>, color green, relation to valestone: `said to contain the essence of all natural life`.
- Name <a href="https://wiki.spiralknights.com/Fiendish_Sol_Glyph" target="_blank">Sol Glyph</a>, color yellow, relation luminite: `said to contain the faith, wisdom, and zeal of the life surrounding it`.
- Name <a href="https://wiki.spiralknights.com/Fiendish_Tor_Glyph" target="_blank">Tor Glyph</a>, color blue, relation to moonstone: `said to contain the knowledge and origins of all worlds`.
- Name <a href="https://wiki.spiralknights.com/Fiendish_Ur_Glyph" target="_blank">Ur Glyph</a>, color purple, relation to dark matter: `said to contain the essences of both chaos and nothingness`.

This concept of color relation, apart from glyphs' color, is found in the texts of "The Key of Solomon the King", which might connect our colors to ones described in the Key through an alchemical interpretation and symbolism found in the descriptions of aforementioned Cradle minerals:

<BookCitation source="The Key of King Solomon the King">

These Pentacles are usually made of the metal the most suitable to the nature of the Planet ; and then there is no occasion to observe the rule of particular colours. They should be engraved with the instrument of Art in the days and hours proper to the Planet.

Names of glyphs are seen in [fiendish cities](#dark-cities) of `Amu-Sol` and `Sol' Fork`, and fiendish legion of Ur, consisting of trojans. The case of dark cities may suggest that glyphs may hold multiple meanings to them, not as letters, but words, as suggested by the naming convention of cities.

Then there is legion of Ur. The presence of Ur name in legion's name, if taken from real world history, implies Ur being legion's commander, a single entity. Other clue stems from the history of the Roman Empire. Their legions' names had nomenclatures which existed throughout internal reforms: numerical, which is not relevant here, and titled. The latter case seems applicable to the trojan legion. In that context, Ur may still be a figurehead's name.

Here we suggest a following interpretation: if the inspirations of "The Key of Solomon the King" are taken into account, with addition of pup-cultural meaning, then glyphs, as written characters, have power to spell entities' names, names of devilites and deities. This may not conflict with the mentioned concept of glyphs, as it is likely there are more of them - as names like Morgral'm exist.

Combined with the depictions of fiendish sigils which may or may not be the same glyphs may potentially reveal a following scenario.

If those sigils are glyphs, and the prior are made of dark matter, may, in the course of the [Minerals and Souls section](#minerals-and-souls-part-1), make them energy carriers, which would explain the logic behind power source of the Grim Gates.

This scenario of glyphs being made of dark matter may reveal potential existence of a _soul-based economy of the Underworld_, but also culture in relation to names. As there are 5 known glyphs, with at least 2 fiendish cities having names which are partially made of those glyphs' names, could it be that glyphs could also refer to Underworld deities?

We believe this distinction must be brought up. On the other hand, there are deities likely inhabiting Underworld, as stated by <a href="https://wiki.spiralknights.com/Wicked_Idol" target="_blank">Wicked Idol</a>: `One of many statuettes carried by fiends as a means of gaining favor with their dark gods`.

Those deities could in fact be [Hail deity](#influences-of-undeworld), [Vile deity](#fiendish-cults), and [Magma deity](#fiendish-cults). [Magma deity](#fiendish-cults) specifically, we believe, is Vog, - by the fact of both exerting fiendish influence or themes. We will also propose of those deities being located in the Underworld,[explored later in relation to Lord Vanaduke](#he-brought-fire-from-the-mountains).

Considering naming convention of glyphs, Vog could plausibly fit there as a name for a fiendish glyph. The latter scenario of those entities, such as Ur, being immortal, can be implied by the name of a division, referred by Morgral'm: `As your division's disciplinary action will undoubtedly result in relocation to the Eternal Torment Division, this will likely be our final correspondence. I wish you luck in your continued career here at Undercorp` (<a href="https://wiki.spiralknights.com/Morgral%27m" target="_blank">Morgral'm - Fiendish Memo</a>), that is based on the concept that devilites are immortal.

##### Undercorp's Graviton Technology

Grim Gates, while of Undercorp development, as seen by the devilite carvings, are based on the same gravity technology by which <a href="https://wiki.spiralknights.com/Graviton_Bomb" target="_blank">graviton bomb</a> operates. Yet, the gates have the capacity to transport living beings, as suggested by the function itself. This requires for _2 gates to be opened to sustain a stable connection_ across material realm or the Underworld. A mechanism can de deduced form the gates' behavior when interacted in the Ancient Grove, as the Call of the Colossi depth starts from the gates' platform.

When activated, grim gates generate a vortex, the same one observed in vortex blocks and graviton bombs. After the vortex forms, a portal at its center opens depicting a dark city-like interior with an inactive tortodrone in sight.

But when vortex of Vortex block or Graviton bomb is presented, instead of a portal, a dark sphere of pulsing matter is only visible during their initial activation phase prior to explosion.

If grim gate's portal is broken in its active or opened state, it explodes in a fiery explosion similar to an <a href="https://wiki.spiralknights.com/Exploration" target="_blank">explosive block</a>. Apart from those similarities there is one important element of portal's life cycle.

##### Grim Gates' Portal Collapse

As seen in the <a href="https://wiki.spiralknights.com/Call_of_the_Colossi" target="_blank">Call of the Colossi</a>, the portals are linked in, at least, pairs. The behavior of devilites seen in danger rooms during tortodrones' Long Migration as well as in the <a href="https://wiki.spiralknights.com/Call_of_the_Colossi" target="_blank">Call of the Colossi</a>, - after all present devilites or tortodrones are removed, currently opened portals explode in the same gravity explosion observed in <a href="https://wiki.spiralknights.com/File:Exploration-Vortex_Block.png" target="_blank">Vortex Block</a>, which over time transforms into much larger, more powerful maelstrom of fiendish pink hue with a flat dark purple core. This __purple maelstrom likely is a result of an open portal on devilite's side being forcibly closed__.

By severing the connection, _something of Underworld nature bleeds into the material realm identified by the pink hue_. In that state the gates may point to a location of no return, as no established portal, a lack of required tech of grim gates themselves would allow for a proper connection, or, more likely, a one-directional connection. This is likely true as the same maelstrom phenomenon is observed in one other case - during resurrection of <a href="https://wiki.spiralknights.com/Margrel" target="_blank">Margrel</a> through the usage of a <a href="https://wiki.spiralknights.com/Book_of_Dark_Rituals" target="_blank">Book of Dark Rituals</a> as discussed in the [summoning section](#margrel-and-immortality-through-curse). The event itself will be analyzed in its appropriate section, but currently only its context is important in relation to the vortex, one attributed to presence of curse associated with this dark-pink color scheme and s broken connection to Underworld. If we take this idea further, _Vortex block and Graviton bomb are weaponizing this phenomenon of improperly crossing realms_.

It was established earlier that the <a href="https://wiki.spiralknights.com/March_of_the_Tortodrones/Ancient_Grove" target="_blank">Ancient grove</a> was part of the <a href="https://wiki.spiralknights.com/Gloaming_Wildwoods" target="_blank">Gloaming Wildwoods</a>. But, Ancient Grove, compared to the Wildwoods, has ruins different from ones present in both locations. This is likely due to it having a special role in titans' culture.

The lager gates used to specifically access the staging area use tortodrone tech, tortodrone arms with possible crimsonite within, as based on the red light emanating from those components. Crimsonite will be further expanded upon. But currently, we may suggest that a much larger gates could have been used to transport devilites and potentially entire cities into the material realm, taken presented variation in grim gates' scale.

Another suggestion can be also made here - "armed" grim gates are the initial portal through which a connection is made. When Spiral Knights arrived to the Ancient Grove, the portal was already active but locked, while the other side does not have the characteristic arms as well as seemingly gremlins' monitors as an interface. Could it be that the portals in Undercorp's possession are constructed in similar manner and linked to portals near the Ancient Grove? Currently, considering all of earlier instances and similarities, this proposal holds up.

#### Snarbolax And Empowerment <span class="through-curse">Through Curse</span>

The excess usage of the gates with the presence of curse had its own effects onto the region. It settled in nearby wildlife, most evident by the presence of Snarbolax within the Gloaming Wildwoods. Snarbolax will serve here the first most distinct case study of curse afflicting creatures of material realm, not by detriment but empowerment, apart from Arkus. So, here it is important to analyze nature of Snarbolax in that context.

Gloaming Wildwoods were inhabited by a <a href="https://wiki.spiralknights.com/Snarbolax" target="_blank">Snarbolax</a>. Items made of its fur (`A coat of coarse fur taken from a Snarbolax` <a href="https://wiki.spiralknights.com/Nightmare_Mane" target="_blank">Nightmare Mane</a>), as well as a few others, have a focus on dangers of sighting Snarbolax. Snarbolax has seemingly supernatural presence going beyond its supposed death during knights' passthrough the Gloaming Wildwoods:

- Snarbolax itself has a default state of invincibility with a <a href="https://wiki.spiralknights.com/Category:Shadow-Themed" target="_blank">shadow color scheme</a>. Dispelled invincibility or stunned state reveals Snarbolax's more <a href="https://wiki.spiralknights.com/File:Monster-Snarbolax_stunned.png" target="_blank">natural fur coat</a>, similar to <a href="https://wiki.spiralknights.com/File:Monster-Alpha_Wolver_3.png" target="_blank">wolvers' 3 color pattern one of which is white accent</a>. Rabid Snarbolax is poison themed, possibly relating to the [poison-themed cults](#fiendish-cults). On the other hand, the <a href="https://wiki.spiralknights.com/Nightmare_Mane" target="_blank">fur</a> acquired from the Shadow Lairs is of color belonging to a shadowed state.
  - Equipment made of this fur - <a href="https://wiki.spiralknights.com/Snarbolax_Cap" target="_blank">Snarbolax Cap</a> and <a href="https://wiki.spiralknights.com/Snarbolax_Coat" target="_blank">Snarbolax Coat</a> both state: `Even looking at it too closely is dangerous`, although currently this could be a hyperbolized writing, we believe it will gain larger connotation in the context of next few items presented.
- Barbarous <a href="https://wiki.spiralknights.com/Barbarous_Thorn_Blade" target="_blank">Thorn blade</a>: `Those who wield it claim to feel the fiery stare of the beast upon them whenever they close their eyes`. The charge attack has a ghostly image of Snarbolax performing a bite, similar to ghostly apparitions of wolver in case of <a href="https://wiki.spiralknights.com/Wild_Hunting_Blade" target="_blank">Wild Hunting Blade's charge</a> and a larger wolver with a snarl and wide red eyes reminiscent of <a href="https://wiki.spiralknights.com/Wolver#Perma-Frostifur" target="_blank">Maulos' Perma-Frostifurs</a>. This blade, notably, also has a poison counterpart - <a href="https://wiki.spiralknights.com/Dread_Venom_Striker" target="_blank">Dread Venom Striker</a>.
- Dark <a href="https://wiki.spiralknights.com/Dark_Thorn_Blade" target="_blank">Thorn Blade</a> which is upgraded to <a href="https://wiki.spiralknights.com/Barbarous_Thorn_Blade" target="_blank">Barbarous Thorn blade</a>, the prior specifies that it is a `savage sword whose strength has been fortified by an offering of souls to the beast within`. With the beast most certainly referring to the Snarbolax.
- Twisted <a href="https://wiki.spiralknights.com/Twisted_Snarble_Barb" target="_blank">Snarble Barb</a> has color scheme of a stunned Snarbolax with its overall green hue and lime-like color reminiscent of <a href="https://wiki.spiralknights.com/Rabid_Snarbolax" target="_blank">Rabid Snarbolax</a> thorns.
- Dark <a href="https://wiki.spiralknights.com/Dark_Briar_Barrage" target="_blank">Briar Barrage</a> on detonation summons ghostly apparition of Snarbolax, with a matching description: `A mythical object that can explode with the fury of the Snarbolax itself. The unearthly howl it produces is said to be more crippling than its blast`.
- Barbarous <a href="https://wiki.spiralknights.com/Barbarous_Thorn_Shield" target="_blank">Thorn Shield</a> imitates Snarbolax's three-eye pattern and states the following: `its said the beast can use the glowing orbs on the shield's face to see and stalk weak-hearted wielders`.
- Dark <a href="https://wiki.spiralknights.com/Dark_Thorn_Shield" target="_blank">Thorn Shield</a> plain specifies: `A gloomy guard that gives one's sword strikes a supernatural savagery`.
- Statues of Snarbolax - <a href="https://wiki.spiralknights.com/Replica_Natural_Snarbolax" target="_blank">Replica Natural Snarbolax</a> and <a href="https://wiki.spiralknights.com/Replica_Shadowy_Snarbolax" target="_blank">Replica Shadowy Snarbolax</a> seem to suggest a definitive, natural, version of Snarbolax.

Based on all of those items it seems, that Snarbolax has a few supernatural properties. There are no enemies, and especially of beast family on Cradle, which would possess such powers, with the exception of <a href="https://wiki.spiralknights.com/Perma-Frostifur#Perma-Frostifur" target="_blank">Perma-Frostifurs</a>. Perma-Frostifurs are invincible and are not delivered from Undercorp, as we suggest by the <a href="https://wiki.spiralknights.com/Amu-Sol" target="_blank">Fiendish Memo</a>, as they are absent in the description of requested items. As it is unknown weather Perma-Frostifurs themselves had originated in the material realm and became such from the effects of everfrost or transformed by Maulos, or creature of the Blinding Abyss.

Then there is such wording as `supernatural savagery`, `unearthly howl`, and mention of souls in the <a href="https://wiki.spiralknights.com/Barbarous_Thorn_Blade" target="_blank">Barbarous Thorn blade</a>.

We propose that those characteristics imply relation to Underworld, as it is one of 2 primary entities who are concerned with souls, or in other words, proposing that Snarbolax became such through an interaction with Underworld, either by itself, of through manipulations of Undercorp.

The final and most evident, as we see it, argument towards intrinsic connection between Snarbolax and curse emerges from 2 items when they are analyzed together:

- Snarbolax's fur - <a href="https://wiki.spiralknights.com/Nightmare_Mane" target="_blank">Nightmare Mane</a>, - is described here: `Each fiber seems to curl and fray as if life is still flowing through it`.
- The <a href="https://wiki.spiralknights.com/Snarbostuffing" target="_blank">Snarbostuffing</a> refers to fur as cursed, as does not decay in its presence, presence of <a href="https://wiki.spiralknights.com/Nightmare_Mane" target="_blank">Nightmare Mane</a>: `A coat of coarse fur taken from a Snarbolax. Each fiber seems to curl and fray as if life is still flowing through it` (<a href="https://wiki.spiralknights.com/Nightmare_Mane" target="_blank">Nightmare Mane</a>), - `A dense, fluffy stuffing made from a special polymer that doesn't break down when exposed to the cursed fur of the Snarbolax. its perfect for creating trophies or adorable, cursed, stuffed toys` (<a href="https://wiki.spiralknights.com/Snarbostuffing" target="_blank">Snarbostuffing</a>), - this recontextualizes Nightmare Mane's description, specifically - `seems to curl and fray as if life is still flowing through it`, - in the frame of animation after death in the practically the same manner as the equipment above.

If it is so then, how it was achieved? We suggest that the source of this supernatural power is the result of improper usage of grim gates near the ancient grove, as the resulting explosions of the portals, discussed earlier have a characteristic, associated with the curse, dark-red and pink mist, present when portal explodes from the other side.

The curse affects only living creatures. Depending on its source, it can be fully detrimental - as in case of Spiral Knights and Nature Sprites, or come with additions - as in case of [Lord Vanaduke](#he-brought-fire-from-the-mountains).

Considering the absence of tortomega and suggested here and by tortodrone mission description (`Investigations into the cause were inconclusive, but Spiral HQ suspects fiends are somehow involved` - <a href="https://wiki.spiralknights.com/March_of_the_Tortodrones" target="_blank">March of the Tortodrones</a>), connection with devilites and Undercorp, this scenario of Underworld's influence on material realm wildlife would be particularly plausible, likely being the exact [pink miasma found in the Shadow Gloaming Wildwoods](#miasma).

Apart from this miasma and a potential offering of souls in <a href="https://wiki.spiralknights.com/Dark_Thorn_Blade" target="_blank">Dark Thorn Blade</a>: `A savage sword whose strength has been fortified by an offering of souls to the beast within`, - the method through which Snarbolax became cursed in the first place, remains unknown.

Under this assumption, we can also explain general thematic shift of alchemy tree of high-tier Snarbolax gear. Last 2 tiers of equipment, 5 and 4 stars', are themed around shadowy Snarbolax, while 2 and 3 star gear is seemingly attributed to stunned or natural Snarbolax, without any explicit supernatural influence.

At that, we propose, that **alchemy tree represents this transformation from natural to supernatural**. Similar, if not exact themes, we believe, are present in the descriptions and context of Snarbolax trophies:

- `A small Snarbolax statuette, showing the savage shadow in a stunned state` (<a href="https://wiki.spiralknights.com/Replica_Natural_Snarbolax" target="_blank">Replica Natural Snarbolax</a>).
- `A large model Snarbolax, depicting in minute detail his jaws that bite and claws that catch` (<a href="https://wiki.spiralknights.com/Replica_Shadowy_Snarbolax" target="_blank">Replica Shadowy Snarbolax</a>).

It seems to us that the name of natural and accompanied Snarbolax's design solidifies it as different state of being from the latter - shadowy, in which Snarbolax is invincible.

As a side note, the grouping of <a href="https://wiki.spiralknights.com/Snarbolax_Slippers#Snarbolax_Slippers" target="_blank">Snarbolax Slippers</a> with the rest of wolver families' slippers in the <a href="https://wiki.spiralknights.com/Cozy_Prize_Box" target="_blank">cozy prize box</a> may suggest that Snarbolax was at some point in time a wolver, or an adjacent specie. And based on the [Snarblepup](<https://wiki.spiralknights.com/Maskeraith_(Snarblepup)>) reskin of Maskeriath battle sprite, we can practically confirm Snarbolax being a canid, despite its muzzle's shape.

#### Tortodrone Equipment

During prosperous time when devilites were met by tortomega, first Undercorp-developed technology emerged in the material realm, and at one point the grim gates themselves. Near that time first issued defenses and weapons for protection of grim gates were made, ones related to shadow damage.

As mostly none of seen grim gates use directly tortodrone tech, it is likely that it came later, yet it was still an advancement.

Only a few alchemical recipes of tortodrone equipment has remained. Among them were things such as combination of tortomega and <a href="https://wiki.spiralknights.com/Gorgo" target="_blank">Gorgo</a> - <a href="https://wiki.spiralknights.com/Gorgomega" target="_blank">gorgomega</a>. But, Gorgomega uses mostly Underworld-related materials in its alchemy, which does relate to gorgos, but what does belong to tortomega? The only material used there and ions unrelated to Underworld directly is the <a href="https://wiki.spiralknights.com/Ancient_Shell" target="_blank">ancient shell</a>. The shield itself is an upgrade of <a href="https://wiki.spiralknights.com/Nether_Shell" target="_blank">Nether Shell</a> which is stated to be `alchemized from the shell of a corrupted tortodrone` (<a href="https://wiki.spiralknights.com/Nether_Shell" target="_blank">Nether Shell</a>). Does this mean that corrupted tortodrones were already present back then? It may be so, but no evidence of that is explicitly found.

At the same time, elemental shield and its alchemy path like <a href="https://wiki.spiralknights.com/Omegaward" target="_blank">Omegaward</a> are seem to be constructed much later, as they utilize Owlite and undead-related materials - <a href="https://wiki.spiralknights.com/Philoso_Feather" target="_blank">Philoso Feather</a> and <a href="https://wiki.spiralknights.com/Ghost_Bell" target="_blank">ghost bell</a>.

There is also <a href="https://wiki.spiralknights.com/Savage_Tortoise" target="_blank">Savage Tortoise</a>, it has piercing defense, stating that `even a rampaging wolver pack would have a hard time puncturing its reinforced plates` (<a href="https://wiki.spiralknights.com/Savage_Tortoise" target="_blank">Savage Tortoise</a>). The shell itself is said to be hardened: `A shield alchemized from a hardened tortodrone shell` (<a href="https://wiki.spiralknights.com/Savage_Tortoise" target="_blank">Savage Tortoise</a>). As the defenses are piercing and the materials there used are <a href="https://wiki.spiralknights.com/Dragon_Scale" target="_blank">Dragon Scale</a> and <a href="https://wiki.spiralknights.com/Critter_Carapace" target="_blank">Critter Carapace</a>, they seem ones giving this defense. Unless there roams a hardened shell tortodrone, this time period when it was invented remains unknown. Although, considering that Spiral Order had experience of using dragon scales in their own alchemy, and presence of wolvers in the description, might actually suggest that piercing-resistant variant of the shell was devised by the Spiral Order on Cradle.

As for the <a href="https://wiki.spiralknights.com/Grand_Tortoise" target="_blank">Grand Tortoise</a> - it seems to be the one most important in overall context of tortodrone-derived shields. It will be kept in mind for the overall relation of tortodrones and crimsonite to rage. But currently it is important to note that mission's preview depict a raging red tortodrone with the same red eye pattern present on its shell. Considering that the starting item of the alchemy tree is the <a href="https://wiki.spiralknights.com/Plate_Shield" target="_blank">Plate Shield</a>, it might only support the idea of alchemy superseding time itself on Cradle, as similar to this shield is used by gremlin <a href="https://wiki.spiralknights.com/Mortafire" target="_blank">Mortafires</a>. The <a href="https://wiki.spiralknights.com/Royal_Core" target="_blank">Royal Core</a> material, on the other hand, seems anachronistic as the slimes had arrived on Cradle not so long ago, this might seem like a substitute for something else. Alchemy of the shell itself suggests that this one is the original one used by tortodrones, as its <a href="https://wiki.spiralknights.com/Stoic_Shell" target="_blank">predecessor</a> states: `A shield alchemized from the shell of a tortodrone.`

At the same time, those items, as they are not seen directly in possession of tortodrones, may point to them being engineered by the Spiral Order or another third party. As it was mentioned earlier, only piercing and shadow alchemy trees of those items are seem to be left vague.

#### Creation of Tortodrone, Undercorp's plot

As the development of tortodrone-related equipment must have to come after the gates, same can be concluded for tortodrones themselves, being engineered around that time. As tortodrones resemble bipedal tortoises, and the established timeline makes point on presence of tortomega civilization, here we suggest that tortodrones are based on tortomega design-wise.

Moreover, it can be proven that this invention was a collaborative effort. Curse is characterized by symbol of an opened eye, one present on tortodrone shell and, more importantly, on metallic helms and wing patterns of <a href="https://wiki.spiralknights.com/Greaver" target="_blank">Greavers</a>. None of the ruins present across Clockworks and Wildwood have eye symbolism, apart from the ever-spread statues, they will be kept in mind fro further analysis.

Tortodrones were built in similar manner to Gun Puppies of tier 1 and other [tortomega' stone constructs](#stone-constructs), used during [the war of dragons and Heavenly kingdom](#war-of-dragons-and-valkyries), having a protective stone exterior and mechanical internals, this pattern is not seen anywhere else. There is <a href="https://wiki.spiralknights.com/Stone_Tortoise" target="_blank">stone tortoise shield</a>, which made of stone: `A large, powerful shield made to resemble a creature's shell.` When tortodrone is defeated, it turns to stone, similar to a trojan, one associated with the Legion of Ur and Underworld, but also containing dark matter crystal embedded. Weather it is dark matter what influences this process of petrification, is unknown, as well as dark matter is the only mineral capable of this process.

So, tortodrones were build in the image of tortomega. Now it is important to attempt to answer the question of why: why tortodrones were manufactured? Most of the hints are located an the ancient grove and depth below - call of the colossi, as well as Morgral'm memos.

In the same memos a staging area is mentioned - `An ID Card is required to access the staging area` (<a href="https://wiki.spiralknights.com/Ancient_Grove" target="_blank">Fiendish Memo (from Morgral'm)</a>), - it is likely the location through which both devilites and tortodrones were sent, as on the other side of the grim gates a dark city interior with vials and an inactive tortodrone is presented.

There are a few locations in the dark cities containing corrupted tortodrones as well as large deposits of dark matter in a seemingly more natural state compared to the pillars at the Clockworks. The very fact that dark cities with names of devilite culture are present in the Clockworks, as described in [dark cities section](#dark-cities), combined with larger grim gates and torn state of dark cities, it is safe to assume that there are much larger grim gates present in the Clockworks, allowing for entire cities to be transported.

And considering that dark matter is found in those cities and labs, as <a href="https://wiki.spiralknights.com/File:Area-Devilish_Drudgery-Scenario_Room5A.png" target="_blank">here</a> and <a href="https://wiki.spiralknights.com/File:Scenario_Room-DevilishDrudgery_2.png" target="_blank">here</a>, are also present there, it is likely that tortodrones were reconstructed mainly in the Underworld and delivered to the material realm. The original construction, that is the shell, carvings and moving parts, judging by the rest of the Wildwoods, was done in the material realm. If they were built in the Underworld, it could be likely that they were made of the same metal that was used in weavers' helms with a symbol of a evil eye.

Then the question rises - why Undercorp would transport tortodrones back and forth? We suggest that this was done later, as part of Undercorp's plot to enter material realm. This likely led to a process of tempering tortodrones, deconstructing them, engraving runes, imbuing with dark matter and stitching back together, and then finally sending them back to erase tortomega civilization.

To better understand the process and details of such tempering and, moreover, arguments affirming this theory, we need to delve into construction and the anatomy of tortodrones.

#### Anatomy of Tortodrone and Crimsonite

At first, the relation between tortodrones and crimsonite had to be addressed.

There is Crimsonite, a mineral found across Clockworks, and used to power the gates, Clockwork gates:

- `A fabled mineral of a fiery, red color said to contain the passion, anger and strength of the life surrounding it` (<a href="https://wiki.spiralknights.com/Crimsonite#Crimsonite" target="_blank">Crimsonite</a>).
- `A shard bomb stuffed with even more depleted Crimsonite` (<a href="https://wiki.spiralknights.com/Super_Shard_Bomb" target="_blank">Super Shard Bomb</a>), - which means that Crimsonite can be depleted through some currently unknown process
- `A large chunk of Crimsonite primed with a potent explosive. No more depleted Crimsonite here: this bomb's made with the good stuff` (<a href="https://wiki.spiralknights.com/Deadly_Shard_Bomb" target="_blank">Deadly Shard Bomb</a>).

Tortodrones, apart from their regular active state, have a raging state, [as depicted on mission card](<https://wiki.spiralknights.com/March_of_the_Tortodrones_(Mission)>).

As described in its properties: `A large chunk of Crimsonite primed with a potent explosive. No more depleted Crimsonite here: this bomb's made with the good stuff` (<a href="https://wiki.spiralknights.com/Deadly_Shard_Bomb" target="_blank">Deadly Shard Bomb</a>), crimsonite can be depleted, yet still damaging. This mineral property can potentially explain the darker shade of shard missiles launched by a tortodrone, which unleash areal damage.

Despite that they still break down to regular crimsonite shards visually, likely that is the result of them being depleted. The crimsonite is `said to contain the passion, anger and strength of the life surrounding it` (<a href="https://wiki.spiralknights.com/Crimsonite#Crimsonite" target="_blank">Crimsonite</a>). These shards are shot from the pistons on top of tortodrone's shell.

Based on the state of corrupted tortodrones, as they are powered by dark matter, we can guess that regular tortodrones are powered by crimsonite, evident by innate aggro aura, one that is part of their engines, the <a href="https://wiki.spiralknights.com/Power_pistons" target="_blank">power pistons</a> within tortodrone. This means, likely both minerals are potent enough to serve as a power source.

In that sense <a href="https://wiki.spiralknights.com/Power_pistons" target="_blank">power pistons</a> serve as tortodrone's core, as they are the one device providing the aggro aura of red lightning and the source of mineral bombardment. That would suggest that shard missiles are actually weaponized unloading mechanism of depleted crimsonite used to power these constructs even in a corrupted state, despite being later powered by dark matter.

Crimsonite is one mineral fed to drakon battle sprites. Those are remade by the Core into an image of Raging Dragons. And, as tortodrone's raging cannon - the <a href="https://wiki.spiralknights.com/Grand_Tortofist" target="_blank">Grand Tortofist</a> - deals normal damage and tortodrones are powered by crimsonite, we believe, it affirms the connection of tortodrones' power source and the crimsonite crystals, same as how dark matter crystals were used to power corrupted tortodrones.

Tortodrones, as constructs, drop <a href="https://wiki.spiralknights.com/Sun_Silver" target="_blank">Sun Silver</a> which is a connection to Heaven and a possible refinement of the <a href="https://wiki.spiralknights.com/Celestial_Ore" target="_blank">Celestial Ore</a>. Both linking to a concept of heaven, but also valkyries of heavenly kingdom. It is unknown how tortomega managed to acquire this resource, although it can be speculated that during the war with heavenly kingdom, tortomega managed to steal it.

Based on corrupted tortodrones' design, it can be concluded with certainty that their shells were deconstructed and then stitched back together.

Then there are a few such instances of placing dark matter into an inactive tortodrone:

- <a href="https://media3.spiralknights.com/wiki-images/1/1b/Scenario_Room-DevilishDrudgery_2.png" target="_blank">Drudgery</a>
- <a href="https://media3.spiralknights.com/wiki-images/a/a1/Scenario_Room-Clockworks_18.png" target="_blank">Clockwork tunnels</a>
- Imagery of opened portals within the grim gates.

The stitched shell has engravings of fiendish sigils on its plates. The central top piece is replaced with dark matter. Dark matter itself, as discussed earlier, is used to power tortodrone same as crimsonite. Considering that the sigils carved in the shell do glow, it is likely that those corrupted tortodrones are in their aggravated state, which has to be red for regular tortodrones and characteristic of aggro aura.

Across sigils covering the shell all sigils are known, apart from one, only present on the back plate of corrupted tortodrones, a cross in a circle. This sigil is most reminiscent of the <a href="https://symbology.wiki/symbol/sun-cross/" target="_blank">sun cross</a> alchemical symbol. This symbol is associated with the sun, and in astronomy, planet Earth.

Then there is <a href="https://wiki.spiralknights.com/Dark_Shard" target="_blank">dark matter</a> itself, it is likely that this is the only, if not most widespread, mineral found in the Underworld. There is also a possibility that dark matter emerging from devilite activity across realms, as a side effect of transportation, as this is the most recent mineral Spiral Order has discovered, as it mainly is used for alchemy of shadow-damaging weaponry and armor. If this mineral was as widespread as the rest, than Isorians were very likely to stumble upon it and discover shadow technology (`The Phantamos represents one of the most recent additions to the Spiral Knight's arsenal, as containing shadow energy of this degree took a great deal of research` - <a href="https://wiki.spiralknights.com/Phantamos" target="_blank">Phantamos</a>).

Based on those ideas we can guess that at some point tortomega were taken advantage of, and through modification of tortodrones, which were made as weapons for their civilization, were annihilated. But, this process required capturing a tortodrone, which may be a reason why there are still many tortodrones present in across Clockworks during the Long Migration. The nature of the migration itself does remain unknown, we can safely suggest, that this process consists of a search for the [veiled homeland](#veiled-tortodrone-homeland) of tortomega, to which Ancient Grove had to belong at some point.

#### The Titans, Tortomega, the Fall

As there are titans present both on the Clockwork gates and descriptions, the key role here, apart from mentioned [ancient titanic equipment](#symbolism-of-stone), players depiction of titan gates, of an entity with a single eye of familiar shape of evil eye from Greavers' helm, holding its hands up, fixated on a sphere.

This seems to us as a most direct depiction of tortomega being related to underworld, as there is no one approaching to Underworld that close. We mean that exactly after tortomega were defeated in a war against valkyries, they discovered Underworld and allowed Undercorp to enter material realm. During that time tortomega earned a title of Titans through sheer technological advancement, perpetuated by Undercorp. And that is before undercorp sabotaged the technology, waging war on tortomega through modified tortodrones - walking gunships: `Investigations into the cause were inconclusive, but Spiral HQ suspects fiends are somehow involved` (<a href="https://wiki.spiralknights.com/March_of_the_Tortodrones" target="_blank">March of the Tortodrones</a>).

Yet, during earlier prosperous time, many shadow technology was developed, as depicted on the Gates icon:

- The titan wears likely a helm, one identical to Greavers'.
- The contained sphere is the graviton core observed in Vortex blocks and Graviton bombs, as well as, partially, grim gate portals.

This two aspects seem wo us extremely strong arguments. But, there is one more - <a href="https://wiki.spiralknights.com/File:Exploration-Heavy_Statue.png" target="_blank">Heavy Statue</a>. They have the ornament evil eye and <a href="https://wiki.spiralknights.com/Troika" target="_blank">Troika</a>, a weapon suggested to belong to tortomega. The further analysis will be concluded in relation to the presence of evil eye in its [own section](#evil-eye).

##### Fomorians and Irish Mythology

We will appeal to irish mythology specifically, due to its later relevance in the context of Almire. Here, we are concerned with the story of Balor - a one-eyed giant, a king of Fomorians, - malevolent civilization from the Underworld, embodying forces of chaos and destruction, at war with pantheon of deities named Tuatha De Danann.

What is important here, is that across the myths, Fomorians were ones ruling over Ireland up to a mythological Battle of Mag Tuired.

The other relation is one of the eye - as mentioned earlier, titans are depicted as cyclops, and possessing a single eye, weather it is a helm or their anatomy, a connection to the eye of Balor could be made here, as in myths, his eye. It symbolizes evil and destructive power, conveniently similar to the dread seal, evil eye of Spiral Knights, which will be discussed soon.

#### Minerals and Souls: Part 1

As it was established, dark matter and crimsonite can be charged. This ability allows minerals be used as a power source for the Clockwork gates, tortodrones' operation, and alchemizing explosives.

At that, the Luminite also can be charged, as stated: `A shard bomb formed from a small explosive encased in solar-charged Luminite` (<a href="https://wiki.spiralknights.com/Sun_Shards" target="_blank">Sun Shards</a>).

Based on shard missiles of tortodrone-derived weapons, <a href="https://wiki.spiralknights.com/Savage_Tortofist" target="_blank">Savage Tortofist</a> should be covered separately. <a href="https://wiki.spiralknights.com/Savage_Tortofist" target="_blank">Savage Tortofist</a> uses valestone in alchemy, but the color of ammo suggest it being Luminite, yellow. This change in color, apart from being a potential design inconsistency, can be resolved through later described tendency of minerals, once charged, to change color, as suggested by other weapons:

- Sun-charged Luminite is greener, as seen in <a href="https://wiki.spiralknights.com/Sun_Shards" target="_blank">Sun Shards bomb</a>: `A shard bomb formed from a small explosive encased in solar-charged Luminite`. Luminite is used in recipe of the <a href="https://wiki.spiralknights.com/Omega_Tortofist" target="_blank">Omega Tortofist</a>.
- Red shards of Crimsonite are not as dark in the missiles of <a href="https://wiki.spiralknights.com/Grand_Tortofist" target="_blank">Grand Tortofist</a>, compared to the shards shot by a corrupted tortodrone. Tortodrone uses crimsonite shot from its core of power pistons, likely as a weaponized mechanism of disposing depleted crimsonite.
- Charged dark matter is pink, it will be covered in [case of Arkus and trojans](#trojans).

This might suggest that mounted or equipped cannons use charged minerals as they are remade from tortodrones' designs.

We can also suggest, that all minerals found in the Clockworks, posses an internal charge but in small amount, making them applicable resource in powering the gates in large quantities (<a href="https://wiki.spiralknights.com/Blue_Shard" target="_blank">Blue Shard</a>).

Where does this charge come from - <a href="https://wiki.spiralknights.com/Heart_of_Ice/Everfrost_Tower" target="_blank">Heart Of Ice's Everfrost Tower</a> may hint at it: now disregarding origins of Maulos, it is said that Everfrost, the tower of which very much resembles <a href="https://wiki.spiralknights.com/Minerals#Moonstone" target="_blank">moonstone</a> is utilized by fiends in `large deposits of the stuff to trap the souls of the lost within it, like some kind of icy prison` (<a href="https://wiki.spiralknights.com/Heart_of_Ice/Everfrost_Tower" target="_blank">Everfrost Tower - Recon Ranger</a>).

As moonstone and everfrost are separate materials, as well as their usage in crafting does differ, we can at least suggest, that everfrost itself has similar properties as a mineral, capable of being arranged into a pillar. More similarities to minerals and everfrost are found by the fact that everfrost is present in Maulos' back as dark matter in trojans. And only in case of Maulos everfrost is seen protruding from the skull, partially covering it. Once Maulos is defeated, Everfrost shard shatters, same as dark matter shatter when trojan is defeated.

Another topic is what material was used to draw pale circles near Everfrost Tower and Call of the Colossi? Then there is a ritual circle in the Moorcroft Manor. Could moonstone and minerals' charge be originating from trapped souls as in case of everfrost? This may seem far fetched, but at the same time there is dark matter mineral, which is also used to power the gates and be used as a food source for <a href="https://wiki.spiralknights.com/Maskeraith" target="_blank">Maskeraith</a> battle sprites.

Notably, all <a href="https://wiki.spiralknights.com/Everfrost#Usage" target="_blank">Everfrost-related gear</a> uses <a href="https://wiki.spiralknights.com/Valestone#Valestone" target="_blank">Valestone</a> in crafting - `A fabled mineral of a vibrant green color said to contain the essence of all natural life`. Could it be that the stated `essence of all natural life` is the soul, or more generally, aspects of a soul? This may be also hinted by <a href="https://wiki.spiralknights.com/Primal_Spark#Treasure_Box_Tokens" target="_blank">sparks</a> found across Clockworks: Grim Spark, Primal Spark and Forge Spark.

Apart from regular minerals, there is <a href="https://wiki.spiralknights.com/Rock_Salt" target="_blank">Rock Salt</a>. While it is `infused with absolutely nothing`, is a binding element of other, similar to role of Salt in Alchemy, binding other two of 3 primes, being sulfur and mercury, and also a `preservative against the corruption of the body` (<a href="https://occult-world.com/salt-alchemy/" target="_blank">salt in alchemy</a>). To address the line `infused with absolutely nothing`, - does this mean that properties stated for the rest of minerals are far more literal, than initially guessed, infused with aspects, the same aspects which are captured by sparks earlier? Sparks of Life in that context could represent pure energy, in also literal sense - power of a souls, which, at its core, is energy. Otherwise, this could be a coincidence. But we believe, this connection between energy and souls remains valid due to the notion, which will be discussed in relation to [magical auras](#auras-and-souls) and [Apocrean Engines](#apocrean-engines) - of souls being used to power or to empower. Until then this concept must be kept in mind.

As for the rest of three primes, Luminite could be a stand-in for alchemical sulfur mainly through the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Suns_in_alchemy" target="_blank">connection with the sun</a>, and not its Underworld counterpart, - <a href="https://wiki.spiralknights.com/Brimstone" target="_blank">Brimstone</a>. As sulfur symbolizes driving force, the spirit, or the will of the living beings, luminite is described as `a fabled mineral of a radiant, golden color said to contain the faith, wisdom, and zeal of the life surrounding it.` (<a href="https://wiki.spiralknights.com/Mineral#Luminite" target="_blank">Luminite</a>), which is similar. It can be argued that <a href="https://wiki.spiralknights.com/Mineral#Valestone" target="_blank">Valestone</a> can be an in-universe counterpart to mercury, but it does not seem to have same relation to the Sun, as suggested by <a href="https://wiki.spiralknights.com/Scintillating_Sun_Shards" target="_blank">Scintillating Sun Shards</a>: `A large chunk of solar-charged Luminite primed with a potent explosive`.

Mercury, one representing consciousness, spirit, and soul, may be partially present. There are mercurial sets, such as <a href="https://wiki.spiralknights.com/Mercurial_Mail" target="_blank">Mercurial Mail set</a> and <a href="https://wiki.spiralknights.com/Mercurial_Demo_Suit" target="_blank">Mercurial Demo set</a>. There aren't many leads, apart from accent on speed, and being made of valestone and crimsonite accordingly. The prior one is similar to a concept of fluidity for the mercury prime in alchemy.

One element from the patterns found earlier we can attempt to distill. In alchemy, it was believed that minerals, through their properties correspond to spiritual aspects of the soul. And, minerals themselves possessed, in that framework, souls, which were more of a characteristics and qualities reflected in its' physical properties.

The Moorcroft Manor ritual circle, it is made of either moonstone or valestone. Devilites use dark matter, salt seems to be used only in protective, warding circles, if considered to be such, not in circles used to summon.

The presence of everfrost is marked by ice, as seen with the Everfrost Tower, but, if moonstone and everfrost are the same, than there would be a greater relation present, as well as presence of ice in the Call of the Colossi places of these circles. It is more likely that the mineral used near the everfrost tower marking the treasure is the rock salt. Presence of moonstone there is confusing as Maulos has distinct everfrost shard present at his back, as other trojans, it is not moonstone explicitly, unless there is a greater connection.

Across swords, <a href="https://wiki.spiralknights.com/Voltedge" target="_blank">Voltedge</a> uses moonstone in its alchemy and is colored same as Moorcroft sigils, so, this would lead to the warding circles being made not of everfrost, but salt, as the only remaining element of similar color.

A conflict may arise here, one related to the design of <a href="https://wiki.spiralknights.com/Rock_Salt_Bomb" target="_blank">salt bomb</a> - as it is very similar to <a href="https://wiki.spiralknights.com/Deadly_Splinter_Bomb" target="_blank">splinter bomb</a> which uses luminite, on referred to as synthetic mineral, yet capable of charge. This can be resolved through a thought that the bombs also attempt to use charged minerals, then, salt would change its color as seen with other minerals. <a href="https://wiki.spiralknights.com/Blue_Shard" target="_blank">Moonstone</a> itself is used in crafting of electric gear, and as mentioned earlier, <a href="https://wiki.spiralknights.com/Green_Shard" target="_blank">valestone</a> is used in crafting of frost-themed gear.

This overall behavior in conjunction with dark matter behavior, discussed in the [legion of Ur section](#legion-of-ur), may suggest that these minerals do have a link with souls and the Underworld, but serve as conduits.

##### Apocrean Circles

Where ever Underworld is present, there are souls and related Apocrean Realm. In small glimpse of Apocrean Realm, or its dimensional trap, as suggested by the Lost Soul (`Soon you will find yourself in one of the traps set by the Apocrea. If you are powerful enough to escape then you may be able to save some of the other lost souls along the way` - [Lost Soul](<https://wiki.spiralknights.com/Lost_Soul_(SotA-Haven)#Dialogue>)) there are <a href="https://wiki.spiralknights.com/File:SotA-Gameplay_End.png" target="_blank">yellow or gold ritual circles</a> of the <a href="https://wiki.spiralknights.com/Shroud_of_the_Apocrea/Departure" target="_blank">Departure</a> during the [Shroud of Apocrea](<https://wiki.spiralknights.com/Shroud_of_the_Apocrea_(Mission)>).

They have less common shape and pattern yet seem to be made of the similar material, or rather, mineral, - luminite.

Apocrea, by being vividly inspired by eldrich horror, seems to one of the first civilizations, preceding even Underworld.

And, if we to take an idea of ritual circles to be present in devilite culture and, finally, material realm, as in earlier case of Moorcroft Manor, it seems likely that it is the Apocrean Realm, from where this concept emerged for the first time, and was adopted by the latter civilizations. In that thought framework one important question remains, - why luminite was used, what particularly important properties does it have when compared to, for example, seemingly native to the Underworld, dark matter mineral, apart from a fitting color scheme from a design context? If we introduce themes of alchemy, then this potential luminite would serve as alchemical gold, or, if we to follow Key of Solomon the King, would be attributed to Pentacles of the Sun.

#### Cradle Metaphysics

The notion of souls and minerals contrasts with the fact that Isorians had not discovered elemental or shadow damage for, possibly, eons, suggesting that the themes related to curse or any abnormal nature of material realm are unique to Cradle, as stated: `Why spirits return to the material realm is unknown, trough it is clear that many of the spirits within the Clockworks have come from other worlds` (<a href="https://wiki.spiralknights.com/Weight_of_Darkness" target="_blank">Weight of Darkness</a>), - the entire phenomenon or curse, undeath and shadow damage may be related to unique properties of Cradle, perpetuated by something from its history.

Owlites, Valkyries and Kingdom of Almire aware of elemental and shadow magic, the souls don't leave material realm on Cradle, and Spiral Order with Isorians existing for eons don't aware of shadow and elemental physics. This may seem as a logical leap, but it makes it seem that Almire and Valkyries, then Owlites, were introduced to those physics very early on in the overall timeline of events. To reiterate previous ideas of unique metaphysics of Cradle and the fact that Spiral Order gad existed for a very long time, the space prior had inhabited was already under abnormal influence, related to property of lingering Souls on Cradle, makes it seem that Cradle was their homeworld or one that introduced this new order of physics. To emphasize this idea, it not the Cradle itself could be the reason, but the Core and Whitespace's influence. The Whitespace does contain void souls. While void is not discussed currently, it still remains a characteristic of souls, suggesting an underlying laws, connecting all of the discussed phenomena.

`It is speculated that all fiends within the Clockworks crossed over from a dimension known as the Underworld` - Cradle has crossing realms, with a capacity for anyone to traverse them up to a degree. And it is confirmed by <a href="https://wiki.spiralknights.com/Graveyards" target="_blank">Graveyards</a>: `Graveyards are an unnatural place, a world between worlds where lost souls gather, hungry for the life of any live soul that must pass through.` That same logic can be applied to the <a href="https://wiki.spiralknights.com/Candlestick_Keep" target="_blank">Candlestick Keep</a>, which itself is suspended in same sort of obscured void, allowing for an advanced darkness, specifically grimalkin to enter to material realm in aftermath of the Kataclysm, as it will be dissected in the [Owlites section](#owlites-and-valkyries-of-heavenly-kingdom).

##### Gremlin Containments

It is very likely that gremlins guard the Firestorm Citadel at the <a href="https://wiki.spiralknights.com/Gauntlet" target="_blank">Gauntlet</a> with modern devices and traps. Gauntlet's second depth is of deconstruction zone with a nontrivial name - "Reign of Fire", and the last depth - the ["Last Stand"](https://wiki.spiralknights.com/The_Gauntlet/Last_Stand), which has architecture of the Scarlet Fortress and has always gremlins present at the final arena, accompanied by elite constructs and elemental fiery gun puppies. Overall, this does not seem as a coincidence, but a pattern, also seen in the <a href="https://wiki.spiralknights.com/Ghosts_in_the_Machine" target="_blank">Ghost in The Machine</a> danger mission, discussed in the [GiTM section](#ghosts-in-the-machine).

Firestorm Citadel has itself a dedicated room with a mysterious console embedded behind the throne room, which does not seem accessible from the outside of the molten cavern, as the rest of the citadel, as it is protected by Lord Vanaduke. Does that mean that the console and Clockworks were already present before Vanaduke burned the Citadel? Same logic can be applied to the Royal Jelly Palace, as the artifact console in also present there, embedded into the stonework floor behind throne room of dilapidated, overtaken by Royal Jelly, castle. Here, we must keep in mind, that this palace belongs to the main structure of the Scarlet Fortress, and, by extension, heavenly kingdom, as discussed in the [heavenly kingdom chapter](#chapter-iv-valkyries-of-heavenly-kingdom).

Consoles design is very similar to Clockwork elevators - its holographic monitor panel's sides have practically identical design to Clockwork Elevator side panels of 3 short cylinders extending from the edges in radial manner, a characteristic element of gremlin technology across Clockworks. Moreover, the runes present on the mysterious console and artifact seem to be the same as on the Roarmulus Twins' armor plates. Both of those instances will be covered in the [gremlin conlang section](#gremlin-conlang).

This makes it seem that these consoles were strategically placed into those appropriate locations. Yet the time period remain undefined, it must be covered it order for the events remaining in their expected, or at least, chronologically correct arrangement.

The console couldn't have been placed in the Citadel after it burned. Royal Jelly Palace was overtaken by jellies, but this likely would not stop gremlins from constructing a console.

This also means that the Core itself would not be constructed, as the consoles are related to the Core, both in design as in implied function, which will be covered later.

At the same time, we'll relate to an old hypothesis, one that postulates that the Core, or rather the Whitespace present in material realm, is responsible for the lingering of the curse and interconnection of Underworld with material realm, as well as inability for spirits to leave. That would likely result in the inability for Legion of Almire and Lord Vanaduke to exist as is, as their state required both action on, seemingly, fiends' part as well as for those unnatural curses to linger and have such effect, as nothing else is seen nor encountered by the Spiral Order.

First console was placed into one the citadels of Almire, and the other console within valkyrian halls of the scarlet fortress. This would make gremlins, if they were builders of the Clockworks, one of more ancient civilizations.

As we consider castles of at least 2 powerful civilizations, this placement would seem accurate for consoles to be protected, suggesting that gremlins were building Clockworks or at least introduced those consoles to those civilizations with the Core already requiring such security measures. And if the consoles were installed later, as the civilizations in charge of these castles disappeared, then gremlins would not to be placed that far in the past.

Regarding Almire it is important to note Lab's Biotech quote: `there were massive citadels housing Almire's armed forces and great estates for its noble houses ... We assume the kingdom is still a smoldering ruin somewhere`, which suggests that the Firestorm Citadel was not the single citadel of Almire.

Now there arises another question - are elevators within Scarlet Fortress, Royal Jelly Palace, and Firestorm Citadel diegetic? That is, are they really present in the historical context of those locations? Within current framework they are, and have dedicated icons from gremlins themselves to navigate through.

Considering the fact that Herex hadn't activated the console within the Firestorm Citadel prior to Spiral Order defeating Lord Vanaduke, it seem that it was not an intentional turn of event - that the Almire kingdom would fall. If the Console was constructed after the Citadel burned, gremlins had no reason to wait for Spiral Order to purge it, nor for themselves to secure defenses as seen across the Gauntlet.

On the other hand, Firestorm Citadel was blocking access to the core, and that was the reason why Spiral Order was investigating that structure. This action would seem intentional as the Core was sealed and Artifact hidden, as reported by <a href="https://wiki.spiralknights.com/Crossing_the_Chasm/The_Journey_to_Haven" target="_blank">Herex during Journey to Haven</a>: `Work away from the others. The Order must never know we have the artifact. Find a way to power it. Bring it to me`, yet, this section can spiral out of control, as once the Core is related to the entire concept of the Swarm and gremlins' past, so that will be analyzed separately.

Based on this idea, we suggest that gremlins might be far earlier in the timeline during Cradle construction from other worlds, ones inhabited by Isorian ancestors or relatives, tortomega and valkyries, but after Tortomega passing, as their existence is seemingly separated from the rest of civilizations, yet may be on the same planet, that was consumed by the Core.

Kingdom of Almire, had it to be on Cradle by the time Vanaduke burned the Citadel, it would likely be located on planet's surface with the rest of the kingdoms, as the geographic landmarks play an important part for the Almirian narrative.

Then there is entire concept of the heavenly kingdom, which is also involved into security of the Core through the relation to Royal Jelly Palace.

Both parties were already on Cradle which had its specific influences onto undeath, perpetuated by the Core being already constructed affecting the space around it. As for the lingering presence of devilites that were already stranded, they are related to entire plot of Lord Vanaduke's curse in the mountains, so it will be analyzed [separately in its own section](#he-brought-fire-from-the-mountains).

#### Evil Eye

At the older times, titans, back then as tortomega, were still wielding heavy swords - such as <a href="https://wiki.spiralknights.com/Troika" target="_blank">Troika</a>, as depicted on heavy statues (<a href="https://wiki.spiralknights.com/File:Exploration-Heavy_Statue.png" target="_blank">Heavy Statue</a>), but introduction of Underworld and its physicality caused collision of cultures, their mixing, and integration of fiendish evil eye into Titans' designs during active development of the latter. The evil eye design first appeared within greavers' helms (<a href="https://wiki.spiralknights.com/Greaver" target="_blank">Greaver</a>), and later applied to tortodrone shells, in similar manner as it was resent on Greavers' wings.

As a potential sign of this connection with the Underworld, this transition was depicted in Heavy Statues (<a href="https://wiki.spiralknights.com/File:Exploration-Heavy_Statue.png" target="_blank">Heavy Statue</a>) when titans were still using the heavy cleaver weapons (<a href="https://wiki.spiralknights.com/Troika" target="_blank">troika</a>) but the upper half was one of fiend symbol and more intricate design of evil eye, one present on vortex bombs and their explosions, similar to simple design on greavers' helms and shape of devilite head/ears.

Why heavy statues have ears similar to fiend enemy symbol? Our guess is one that the devilite and titan cultures were so connected, that they transferred a different mythology, one that was present in Underworld as seen in, again, greavers' helms, a depiction of eye. Those being should have been seen by gremlins in order to construct gates with their imagery.

Also <a href="https://wiki.spiralknights.com/Gorgo" target="_blank">Gorgo</a> could be another inspiration fot the one eye, as it already was referred in the <a href="https://wiki.spiralknights.com/Gorgofist" target="_blank">Gorgofist</a>: `A terrifying handgun that combines the dual-crushing power of a gorgo and the mythical tortomega`.

This might be a lead to a greater presence of cyclopean entities, from whom the evil eye design was taken within the Underworld, but it remains unknown. After that, the design was adopted by tortomega in their devices, such as tortodrones.

With the stable technology of Grim Gates, as discussed, entire dark cities (<a href="https://wiki.spiralknights.com/Dark_City" target="_blank">Dark City</a>) could be transported, such as <a href="https://wiki.spiralknights.com/Heart_of_ice" target="_blank">Amu-Sol</a>, and Sol' Fork (`After Recon Knights discovered a fiendish city known as Sol' Fork, Spiral HQ deployed a research team to station itself in the heart of the city and study the devilites within. Their finding have become the basis for our understanding of devilite culture and their motives for working with gremlins` - <a href="https://wiki.spiralknights.com/Whipping_and_Mishandling" target="_blank">Whipping and Mishandling</a>), which existed long before arrival of Undercorp to Cradle (<a href="https://wiki.spiralknights.com/Fiendish_Amu_Glyph" target="_blank">Fiendish Amu Glyph</a>, <a href="https://wiki.spiralknights.com/Fiendish_Sol_Glyph" target="_blank">Fiendish Sol Glyph</a>, <a href="https://wiki.spiralknights.com/Morgral%27m" target="_blank">Morgral'm</a>).

It is unknown weather this activity of Underworld and material realm being connected caused within this area undead spirits to come back from the afterlife, compared to Core scenario, as <a href="https://wiki.spiralknights.com/Totem#Grim_Totem" target="_blank">grim totems</a>, issued to resurrect the Undead remain then unexplained. Yet, as the only undead which are brought back, are zombies, it can be vaguely suggested that grim gates could be used in the same manner in the Underworld, or be an later advancement of Undercorp to Cradle.

Grim totems will be later analyzed in the context of Almire. As for now, both scenarios of totems being introduced with Undercorp or later fit to the timeline at that point in time.

As for the reasons, why Undercorp would expand into material realm, there are mainly speculations, although one more solid scenario can be analyzed efficiently, one related to the Nefarious Imp of Underworld.

##### Nefarious Imp, Arctic Plot

A set comprised of the <a href="https://wiki.spiralknights.com/Nefarious_Raiment" target="_blank">Nefarious Raiment</a>, an armor, and <a href="https://wiki.spiralknights.com/Nefarious_Hood" target="_blank">hood</a> has evil eye symbol incorporated in the most advanced manner ever witnessed, looking seemingly the same as evil eye in <a href="https://wiki.spiralknights.com/Gran_faust" target="_blank">Gran faust</a>, with trident-like marks to the sides of an eye.

As Gran Faust is `an upgraded Faust forged from pristine-quality shadow steel` (<a href="https://wiki.spiralknights.com/Gran_faust" target="_blank">Gran faust</a>) forged in the Underworld (`A powerful, cursed sword forged in the underworld.` <a href="https://wiki.spiralknights.com/Faust" target="_blank">Faust</a>), <a href="https://wiki.spiralknights.com/Shadow_Steel" target="_blank">Shadow Steel</a> is the source for both weapon and armor. <a href="https://wiki.spiralknights.com/Wicked_Idol" target="_blank">Wicked Idol</a> in that regard has similar design, and it also originated from the Underworld.

Shadow steel's `An extraordinary metal imbued with the creeping darkness of the Underworld` darkness may be the one abstract entity to which Sleeper will refer in the [Swarm section](#the-swarm), although this is more of a speculation, we should start to keep track of everything referred as darkness.

The designs of this set may suggest that this Imp was one responsible for evil eye designs of Underworld army, as evident by <a href="https://wiki.spiralknights.com/Greaver" target="_blank">Greavers</a> and its unique armour. The hood, on the other hand, is reminiscent of Apocrea cultist <a href="https://wiki.spiralknights.com/Obsidian_Hood_of_Rituals" target="_blank">obsidian hoods</a>. The description of <a href="https://wiki.spiralknights.com/Nefarious_Hood" target="_blank">Nefarious Hood</a>: `The floating hood is certain to cloak you during clandestine campaigns`, the `clandestine campaigns` is similar to one of <a href="https://wiki.spiralknights.com/Arctic_Rogue_Mask" target="_blank">Arctic Rogue Mask</a>: `The shattered ice will conceal your identity during clandestine arctic expeditions`. The arctic set is part of <a href="https://wiki.spiralknights.com/Glacial_Prize_Box" target="_blank">Glacial Prize Box</a>.

This is a part of <a href="https://wiki.spiralknights.com/Arctic_Rogue_Mail" target="_blank">Arctic Rogue Mail</a> which also has evil eye symbol on its belt. With this armor comes the <a href="https://wiki.spiralknights.com/Arctic_Acolyte_Mantle" target="_blank">Arctic Acolyte Mantle</a> and <a href="https://wiki.spiralknights.com/Arctic_Acolyte_Hood" target="_blank">Arctic Acolyte Hood</a> which are possibly connected to the Apocrea: `A hood said to be worn by wandering arctic acolytes. 'we saw them heading straight towards the mountains, off into the interior of the vast frozen continent, but why?'`

The Apocrea, being an eldrich realm in that arctic context fits the fabula of ["In the Mountains Of Madness"](https://lovecraft.fandom.com/wiki/At_the_Mountains_of_Madness), which will be discussed at the [Apocrean Engines section](#apocrean-engines), but currently we need to keep in mind a general eldritch cosmic entities' motif.

This Arctic expedition could be a reason for <a href="https://wiki.spiralknights.com/Maulos#Maulos" target="_blank">Maulos</a> to exist, as it was likely summoned as in case of the <a href="https://wiki.spiralknights.com/The_Return_of_Ur" target="_blank">Legion of Ur</a>.

To continue this notion, Amu-Sol, as described in the <a href="https://wiki.spiralknights.com/Heart_of_ice" target="_blank">Heart of Ice</a> briefing: `Freak snowstorms and blizzards have begun surging through the depths seeming to originate from an inhospitable, fiendish city known as 'Amu-Sol'`, may be a stand-in for the eldrich stone city beyond the Mountains of Madness, although this is likely a coincidence.

Despite this intermissions, overall setting would suggest that the Nefarious Imp was behind Heart of Ice plot, and, considering its armor, its knowledge of the Curse and wielding of shadow steel, and possibly, Gran Faust, it would be a plan to be carried out by the rogue devilites of Undercorp, as they were becoming everfrost fanatics. The act of bringing back Maulos could also be a continuation of the same methodology of bringing back trojans from Underworld through the usage of ritual circles. And, as it was proven, the process was too slow to bring back entire legion onto Cradle. A possible solution could be to that - to empower a few trojans with the same curse that afflicted Vanaduke, that is through unnamed Hail Deity - one discussed earlier in the [Maulos section](#influences-of-underworld).

Herein we suggest a possible solution, different from ones discussed earlier on disappearance of Titans - one related to the themes of <a href="https://lovecraft.fandom.com/wiki/Shoggoth" target="_blank">Lovecraft's Shoggoth</a>. In that universe they were created to assist in building mentioned stone cities - and then civilization of creators was extinct due to war with other species arriving to Earth. <a href="https://wiki.spiralknights.com/Arctic_Acolyte_Mantle" target="_blank">Arctic Acolyte Set</a>: `we saw them heading straight towards the mountains, off into the interior of the vast frozen continent`, - links the acolytes of Apocrean design with the story of <a href="https://lovecraft.fandom.com/wiki/At_the_Mountains_of_Madness" target="_blank">At the Mountains of Madness</a>, which contains one of the possible locations for an inter-dimensional <a href="https://lovecraft.fandom.com/wiki/Plateau_of_Leng" target="_blank">Plateau of Leng</a>, which is similar to <a href="https://wiki.spiralknights.com/The_Grasping_Plateau" target="_blank">the Grasping Plateau</a>, with both housing a powerful cloaked figure: on Cradle it is Apocrean Harvester, and within Leng its <a href="https://lovecraft.fandom.com/wiki/High_Priest_Not_to_Be_Described" target="_blank">the High Priest</a>, another eldrich entity. Apart fro it, Scarabs and Lovecraftian influence could point to another theme across Lovecraftian Mythos, specifically, the <a href="https://lovecraft.fandom.com/wiki/Nameless_City" target="_blank">Nameless City</a> in the desert, and [short story "Nyarlathotep"](<https://lovecraft.fandom.com/wiki/Nyarlathotep_(short_story)>), which contain themes of Ancient Egypt.

Now considering tortodrone corruption, the extinction of titans was continuous, first caused by possibility of war with Heavenly Kingdom, then a internal affair of corrupted tortodrones by devilites and Undercorp.

Nefarious Imp will be later addressed in the [Moorcroft manor past the heavenly kingdom section](#moorcroft-manor-past-heavenly-kingdom) in relation to Underworld expansion and then resolved in the [Resurrection of Margrel](#margrel-and-immortality-through-curse).

##### Operation Gelid and other methods of escaping Cradle

At the same time, presence of Spiral Knights' armor within the <a href="https://wiki.spiralknights.com/Glacial_Prize_Box" target="_blank">Glacial Prize Box</a> roster might suggest that Imp could be involved though the design similarities to the apocrean gear. Those being:

- `A plated robe said to be worn by wandering arctic acolytes. 'we saw them heading straight towards the mountains, off into the interior of the vast frozen continent, but why?'` (<a href="https://wiki.spiralknights.com/Arctic_Acolyte_Mantle" target="_blank">Arctic Acolyte Mantle</a>).
- `A hood said to be worn by wandering arctic acolytes. 'we saw them heading straight towards the mountains, off into the interior of the vast frozen continent, but why?'` (<a href="https://wiki.spiralknights.com/Arctic_Acolyte_Hood" target="_blank">Arctic Acolyte Hood</a>).

Notably, in the <a href="https://forums.spiralknights.com/en/node/107155" target="_blank">forum post</a>, which is an in-universe email, it is said that `Spiral HQ has embarked upon OPERATION GELID. An assortment of items are available to you, including the following`, which in the above context might mean that Spiral HQ itself has an undisclosed relation to Underworld and Apocrea, possibly resulting in the events of <a href="https://wiki.spiralknights.com/Heart_of_ice" target="_blank">Heart of Ice</a>, as there had to be a reason behind this arctic expedition.

Considering that at that point in time the only goal of Spiral Order was to field energy source and leave Cradle, and the totality of many discoveries of Spiral Order in relation to elemental and shadow damage, Spiral HQ could very likely to be planning for other scenarios.

It is important to note that the presence of Apocrean armors and arctic setting might point to a certain inspiration, visited in the [Apocrean Engines section](#apocrean-engines), that of a story <a href="https://lovecraft.fandom.com/wiki/At_the_Mountains_of_Madness" target="_blank">In the Mountains Of Madness</a> by Howard Lovecraft. But here, apart from eldritch presence nothing else could be extracted from this potential inspiration.

#### Strangers and Haven

Strangers are one of more illusive civilizations on Cradle despite direct interaction of Isorians with them during the aftermath of Skylark crash landing.

In order to understand them, we will start from their currently known town, Haven.

Haven itself is a rather unique location. It is a small town seemingly built on the slope of a mountain. Inside the mountain or likely on its other side is the Arcade - a large Clockwork terminal with an access to the Clockwork gates, whose pathways eventually lead up to the Core Terminal.

Haven is surrounded by a wall, with a central entrance guarded by a sliding mechanical gates, identified by a gear track and a gear itself.

Below main entrance to Haven a large chasm with a set of Clockwork tunnels containing the Artifact and Razwog's power complex facility is located. We will keep this placement in mind for the analysis of gremlins.

On the east side of the town square located the Lab and Guild Hall. Now, considering size of Haven, we suggest that the guild hall canonically contains the Spiral Headquarters, as the building itself seem to be a mechanical, fortified 3-story structure with ribbed walls and small horizontal windows. Notably, its underground level seems to be located within a small cavern within the same mountain as the Arcade, with rooms suspended above the Clockworks. Ribbed walls are designed to enhance structural integrity. A partially upgraded guild hall has at its central section a large table with, supposedly, Skylark equipment, same as in the Lab in form of the secondary generator. Judging by the room itself, it seems likely that it is the briefing room of Spiral HQ. The general outline depicted within the Lab above the alchemy station, considering Lab's location, likely points to the inner layout of potentially fully upgraded Guild Hall, as evident by presence of the aforementioned room.

The Lab, while it contains an on-site Isorian research facility, seems also to have an underground level. We make such guess based on 2 elements:

- An unlit pit below the secondary Skylark reactor and an empty space around and below the room where Artifact was held
- The mechanical, Clockwork tunnels-like design and the events of <a href="https://wiki.spiralknights.com/A_New_Threat/Lobby" target="_blank">A New Threat</a>. (`we're starting to get an alarming number of reports of gremlins mobilizing in the Clockworks below Haven` - <a href="https://wiki.spiralknights.com/A_New_Threat/Lobby" target="_blank">Kora</a>) suggest that the lower layers of the Lab are directly connected to the tunnels below.
- Haven has a location of exposed metal-plated floor similar to the Rescue Camp. The latter case has a direct exposed pit, while in Haven the place being the forge with Vise and Punch located there. Considering the earlier argument of a direct connection to clockwork tunnels, due to this pattern, such proposal seems to us as relatively plausible.

On the west side of Haven there is the bazaar. Considering how small the town is, and how geographically isolated it is between a mountain and a chasm, yet accessible from the Clockworks, we suggest that there are likely another similar to Haven, trade-oriented towns, with a population of Strangers built around Arcade-like Clockwork Terminals in an established network of trading routes.

The trading aspect can be inspected closer - that is the design behind Strangers and their culture.

First of, they seem to live in an lush warm area near the mountain range. The town, apart from the town square is decorated with canopy of designed with patterns fabric cloths hung between of near buildings' walls. The material from which houses are built, are more ofter white, simplistic, occasionally spiral, stoneworks and masonry, or Clockwork metalwork, seemingly used in more secured areas, such as the Lab or auction house on the town square. Buildings are usually not higher than 2 stories, with a few sparsely placed water pools.

##### Culture of Strangers

Then there are Strangers' designs of tall figures, obscured by long-sleeved cloaks and brimmed hats with masks. Strangers usually have an inventory equipped, seemingly protected from the environment as judged by the cloth placed on top of it. To make accent on masks, gremlins <a href="https://wiki.spiralknights.com/Punch" target="_blank">Punch</a> and <a href="https://wiki.spiralknights.com/Vise" target="_blank">Vise</a>, who also have masks of this similar design with one eye being a horizontal slit, although not glowing as the other eye of Strangers' helms.

This makes us think of a region with a warm, possibly dry climate, and, while not explicitly, a nomadic, resourceful culture. This may be a fitting design, as for the location of Haven - it is surrounded by large clusters of revealed Clockworks. We can suggest that Cradle at that point oin ime is still being built, although there is an instance of revealed to the surface Clockwork depths being a location of planetary defenses, we will keep it in mind, as it was the reason behind Skylark crash landing. Semi-nomadic lifestyle of Stranger in that sense can be attributed to a risk of Cradle incorporating more matter to its surface, so this might lead to nearby population centers to embark through arcade and underlying clockwork tunnels to a different location.

Those inspirations might have been considered, due to disclosed inspiration behind Haven's `Haven's original look resembled something similar to a Ald'ruhn from The Elder Scrolls: Morrowind. As you might imagine, it really didn't look right` (<a href="https://forums.spiralknights.com/en/node/20773" target="_blank">10 things you didn't know about Spiral Knights</a>).

Outside of Haven there is a <a href="https://wiki.spiralknights.com/Blades_of_the_Fallen" target="_blank">graveyard</a>, which contains the first instance of Lost Souls. This graveyard differs drastically from the rest of graveyards, as it is characterized by a field fo revered arms, a military funeral, most certainly attributed to Spiral Order as a military structure.

##### Cradle Festivals

There are a few celebrations in Haven:

- <a href="https://wiki.spiralknights.com/The_Dark_Harvest" target="_blank">Dark harvest</a>.
- <a href="https://wiki.spiralknights.com/Winterfest" target="_blank">Winterfest</a>.
- <a href="https://wiki.spiralknights.com/Equinox_Prize_Box" target="_blank">Cradle Equinox</a>: `The Strangers pause at the equinox to recognize the brief moment of cosmic balance on Cradle. For just a breath of time, there is harmony between night and day, the sun and moon, and symmetry in the celestial sphere` (<a href="https://forums.spiralknights.com/en/node/98178" target="_blank">Balance of the Equinox</a>).
- Not particularly and event, but a tendency of <a href="https://wiki.spiralknights.com/Shroud_of_the_Apocrea" target="_blank">Shroud of the Apocrea</a> resurging over Cradle, it will be analyzed shortly

#### Analysis of Apocrean Realm

As Cradle has a connection to the Underworld, in at least 2 instances:

- First, there were tortomega, who allowed Undercorp to enter material realm, explored in [Arrival of Undercorp](#chapter-vi-arrival-of-undercorp),
- Second, there are gremlins, who are reported to outsource development of projects against Spiral Knights (`Analysis of the data collected from these offices indicates that devilite corporations are outsourced by gremlins in order to design and manage various projects that include weapons specifically engineered to target Spiral Knight squads` - <a href="https://wiki.spiralknights.com/Work_for_Idle_Hands" target="_blank">Work for Idle Hands</a>).

Apocrean Realm, on the other hand, remains hidden. Yet, there is a hint to understanding its logic: `Only souls keep these engines roaring, heard screaming across distant stars. Only souls can fill their void, sublime in its vast emptiness. Oh such beautiful souls! Bright and vibrant like fruit warming on the branch from a summer's sun, longing for the pull of the earth below, the chance to seed and grow and birth anew` (<a href="https://forums.spiralknights.com/en/node/91276" target="_blank">Professor Allister Danford</a>) as well as `The Apocrea are ... a terrible legion of otherworldly phantasms whose only ambition seems to be trapping and devouring the souls of all life` (<a href="https://wiki.spiralknights.com/Shroud_of_the_Apocrea/The_Obsidian_Nexus" target="_blank">Obsidian Nexus - Lost Soul</a>).

And, as there are souls to be freed across the <a href="https://wiki.spiralknights.com/Shroud_of_the_Apocrea/The_Grasping_Plateau" target="_blank">Grasping Plateau</a>, one being a nod to <a href="https://lovecraft.fandom.com/wiki/Plateau_of_Leng" target="_blank">plateau of Leng</a>, it is very likely that the souls are the resource by which Apocrean Realm is motivated to reach out to material realm.

As for Allister Danford, - he likely represent a similar figure, <a href="https://lovecraft.fandom.com/wiki/Danforth" target="_blank">Danforth</a> of the events of ["In the Mountains Of Madness"](https://lovecraft.fandom.com/wiki/At_the_Mountains_of_Madness), where Plateau of Leng was supposedly present. It is also worth noting, that Apocrean activity, as eldritch entity is also capable of causing insomnia, as evident by the memorandum: `We at Spiral HQ are concerned about a spike in the number of knights who push themselves to the limit with lack of sleep, and Medical has noted a similar uptick in knights who want to sleep, but can't. We suspect this is at least partly due to recent Apocrean activity in the Clockworks` (<a href="https://forums.spiralknights.com/en/node/111472" target="_blank">Sleep is for the Strong</a>).

There is also the <a href="https://wiki.spiralknights.com/Perplexing_Element" target="_blank">Perplexing Element</a>: `A rare metal recovered from a shattered mountain deep within the realm of the Apocrea.` - the fact that a metal was recovered from a shattered mountain makes us think of great onyx canyons on the north of Dreamlands. Onyx was used as primary building material for civilization of Inganok and a particular onyx castle for Elder Gods at the top a monumental mountain Kadath as revealed by the events of the "<a href="https://lovecraft.fandom.com/wiki/The_Dream-Quest_of_Unknown_Kadath" target="_blank">Dream-Quest of Unknown Kadath</a>".

Graveyard of <a href="https://wiki.spiralknights.com/Blades_of_the_Fallen" target="_blank">Blades of the Fallen</a> outside of Haven contains an obelisk, we believe that it is a miniature version of the ziggurat found in the <a href="https://wiki.spiralknights.com/Shroud_of_the_Apocrea/The_Obsidian_Nexus" target="_blank">Obsidian Nexus</a>, if a case of asset reuse to be omitted. It is important also to note in the context of tortodrones, Call of The Colossi contains the same rectangular obelisk located to to the left of the entrance elevator and before the arena, suggesting that it is th result of the same cultural and architectural phenomenon of ritual circles being spread to Cradle and its civilizations from the Underworld. It might seem a logical leap, but in the overall context it may not seem such.

Yet this may only hint to Underworld or Apocrean culture remotely effecting civilizations on Cradle, as it bleeds in through the shroud.

Finally it is important to specify connection of Underworld and Apocrean Realm in their common relation to souls, partially covered in the [Minerals and Souls section](#minerals-and-souls-part-1).

Everfrost tower brought from Underworld functions as a prison for the souls. Then there are auras, which Black Kats consume.
Apocrean Realm sets up traps across clockworks, which lead up to the Apocrean Harvester.

In relation to Apocrea, one entity is seemingly native to Underworld - <a href="https://wiki.spiralknights.com/Scarab" target="_blank">Scarabs</a>, - as they can be coupled with even devilites across <a href="https://wiki.spiralknights.com/Shroud_of_the_Apocrea/The_Grasping_Plateau" target="_blank">Grasping Plateau</a>.

Amongst those elements one thing in particular will be very important: `The Apocrea bend reality, twisting the environment they invade into a trap` (<a href="https://wiki.spiralknights.com/Shroud_of_the_Apocrea/The_Obsidian_Nexus" target="_blank">Obsidian Nexus - Lost Soul</a>), - an ability to warp reality, an eldritch ability.

Due to those properties of Apocrean Realm, we suggest that it serves in a long term a far greater danger to material realm, essentially both dependant on it due to presence of souls there. So, this would mean that souls are formed or at least arrive to material realm, and are nonexistent in the Underworld, despite having many purposes there.

##### The Metaphysical Stack

It is here that we may begin to build a vertical stack of realms, where souls, for lack of better word, flow from top to bottom. And we propose that at the very bottom of this stack is is not the Apocrean Realm, but Blinding Abyss, although a speculation, due to the fact that there are free-themed enemies, Dreadnoughts, scarabs, bombies and zombies in the Grasping Plateau. It is such due to a connotations of the Abyss across cultures - the deepest point of the world.

So the is material realm, it is connected with Underworld, although requiring a ritual or a device, such as grim gates. Undercorp is located in the Underworld. Below the Underworld, it is Apocrean Realm, a possibly even more ancient location. An finally, there is Blinding Abyss, whose elements have a significant power over material realm as seen during the events of <a href="https://wiki.spiralknights.com/Heart_of_ice" target="_blank">Heart of Ice</a>.

Three of the latter realms are all connected, but very little of them communicate with material realm. In the end one final realm remains, which was mentioned at the very beginning of the theory - the Nameless Realm (`A forbidden mantle said to grant the wearer protection within the nameless realm where all elements are said to converge into one and divide into all` - <a href="https://wiki.spiralknights.com/Chaos_cloak" target="_blank">Chaos cloak</a>). We will revisit it later, as in order to analyze it, we have to cover rest of history and Cradle itself, including gremlins.

On that note, one thing in particular will be looked at, but as of currently will be only kept in mind until further notice, a specific wording in Danford's journal entry: `All of them mere crops against their relentless scythe! Though they may steal sanctuary in the cracks and corners of their terrible realm, it is ever fleeting. The blinding gaze of the Apocrea is boundless` (<a href="https://forums.spiralknights.com/en/node/91276" target="_blank">Professor Allister Danford</a>).

##### Apocrean Engines

As discussed in the [Auras and Souls section](#auras-and-souls), Apocrea dreams/creates into reality unknown machines, powered by souls. At the same time, souls are sought after by Apocrea for potentially other uses. Kat Tribe, its members that were summoned to Clockworks from `some dark portal`, despite being undead still have an ability, possibly a supernatural one, to consume auras.

Considering Apocrean Realm is an eldritch location, it must be analyzed on the notion of dreams in relation to Outer Gods of Lovecraft's universe. This notion of dreams, of course, will be later important in the context of the Core, Whitespace, Sleeper and the Swarm, but here it is not the main topic.

As Dreamlands were already mentioned as a potential inspiration behind the design of the obsidian architecture, we will touch upon the role of dreams in their universe:

- Carter had to travel to the Dreamlands in search of the dreamt sunset city. It is suggested by Nyarlathotep, that the city was stollen by the Old Gods due to its beauty, but this information cannot be trusted.
- <a href="https://lovecraft.fandom.com/wiki/The_Dreams_in_the_Witch-House" target="_blank">The Dreams in the Witch-House</a> tell about a different side of the nature of dreams - as a method of transportation into other realities, traversal through those realities, other locations and time periods.
- The same ability to travel higher realities and time periods is also examined by the Silver Key in the story of <a href="https://lovecraft.fandom.com/wiki/Through_the_Gates_of_the_Silver_Key" target="_blank">Through the Gates of the Silver Key</a>, its prequel and sequels.
- Azathoth dreams up the existence of the Universe, allowing it to persist as long as it sleeps.

Although this is not much context on dreams, it may allow us to better understand this notion. But, in order to make conclusion about it, we have to analyze, of course, the Sleeper within Cradle's Core, while keeping Lovecraftian inspirations for potential background information and themes in mind.

<center class="chapter-break">
  <span class="energy">☉</span>
</center>

<h3 align="center">Chapter <code>VII</code>: Kingdom of Almire</h3>

Kingdom of Almire as stated by multiple sources, was invaded by 2 nearby kingdoms.

In-game content creates a vague description of the timeline, mostly outlining general themes, but we can find a more precise and detailed description of those event, one which connects the idea of fire deity and Lord Vanaduke. The existence of 3 kingdoms, their ongoing conflict, an the aftermath are given by a short story of Almire's Fall: `The citadel comes from a land divided by constant war between the nations of three kingdoms. ... It was ruled by a young and determined king known as Lord Vanaduke. Praised for his military ability, it was because of this that Almire was a powerful nation despite it being the smallest of the three. Given time it could expand to a mighty empire. It was because of this the other two kings feared him and formed a truce to invade Almire. Vanaduke's army was stretched too thin and Almire quickly began to fall under the weight of the two combined armies` ([Almire's Fall](https://wiki.spiralknights.com/index.php?title=Firestorm_Citadel&oldid=1263)). Almire's Fall lore entry had originated on the official wiki, rather than forums or items' descriptions, and it shows the author of the story snippet is one of the core member of developer's team. We consider it as a solid proof of this entry being canon to an overarching story.

As there are 2 kingdoms specified to exist near Almire, we propose that those are northern Raiders, discussed [for the first time](#spiral-raiders) in the context of Isorian and spiral designs, and the Kingdom of Ironmight. We will analyze location of those kingdoms for potential geography after the initial analysis of Ironmight domain.

As for the truthfulness of the concept that Isorians were indeed on Cradle or a planet preceding - one last idea we have to include here, that is more of a conclusion than a discovery: if [Iron Hulk](#ghosts-in-the-machine) is Isorian or Morai and is hundred years old, why there were not to be a second case of an even more ancient space vessel? If Cradle or a planet preceding it was already found prior, time span of several hundred of years does not seem to us a restriction, then considering that Isorians themselves are eons old already as a spacefaring civilization, that seems to us at least as probable, and as it is seen here, utilized in the multiple elements of the timeline.

The latter concept of a particular entity of Ironmight in the context of kingdom of Almire was also proposed separately from our own research by user Magnicth on <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/spiral_knights/comments/zakpe/the_ironmight_theory/" target="_blank">Spiral Knight subreddit</a>.

#### Ironmight Kingdom

The name Ironmight makes us think of other similar instances of naming conventions of empires and kingdoms:

- Kingdom of the Netherlands, meaning a lower land, lower elevation, a property of geographical location.
- United Kingdom, one that consists of multiple entities united by a monarch.
- Holy Roman Empire combines an adjective, - Holy, - with a city of Rome.
- The British Empire refers to the empire ruled by Britain.

As for Ironmight, judging by its name, it is derived from a descriptive term of might and is combined with iron, iron and might, - the might of iron, - we suggest that it is a kingdom, one similar to Almire, with part of its identity being rooted in its military power. We can exclude a possibility of it being an empire, as we will attempt to fit in with the lore entry of Almire' Fall.

The basis for the name itself is taken from the <a href="https://wiki.spiralknights.com/Ironmight_Plate_Mail" target="_blank">Ironmight set</a>:

- `A superior shield forged from sun silver. The meaning of the crest on its face has been lost to time` (<a href="https://wiki.spiralknights.com/Ironmight_Plate_Shield" target="_blank">Ironmight Plate Shield</a>). its emblem the same emblem of a crown on the coins found across Clockworks, persisting on Cradle to this day.

  The dimensions of the currency crown are the same as the ironmight plate shield emblem, but also there are matching stars symbols in cardinal direction present on the outer ring of the emblem and of the <a href="https://wiki.spiralknights.com/Crowns#Finding_Crowns" target="_blank">coins</a> af all values.

  This particular coincidence does seem intentional, due to application of that symbol on the shield specifically. The other similar shield with a mysterious glowing emblem - <a href="https://wiki.spiralknights.com/Volcanic_Plate_Shield" target="_blank">Volcanic Plate Shield</a> also implies an intentional design choice, but will be covered later.

  One thing is particular may point both in that direction as well as in relation to existence of slime families: `An extremely rare metal of great power said to be from the heavens above. It is often completely wasted on crowns and jewelry for slime royalty` (<a href="https://wiki.spiralknights.com/Celestial_Ore" target="_blank">Celestial Ore</a>). From the celestial ore one other element of kingship or royal position is made - the <a href="https://wiki.spiralknights.com/Ice_Queen_Crown" target="_blank">Ice Queen Crown</a> as it uses Celestial Ore in its alchemy.

  It is usual across history for crowns be made of rare, precious metals, but also that same notion can be attributed coins, - in case of Spiral Knight, crowns, which are also metallic as seen from their designs.

  There is also presence of <a href="https://wiki.spiralknights.com/Sun_silver#Usage" target="_blank">sun silver</a>, which was present in Isorian equipment - such as <a href="https://wiki.spiralknights.com/Azure_Guardian_Armor" target="_blank">Azure Guardian armor and weapons</a> and <a href="https://wiki.spiralknights.com/Valkyrie_Mail" target="_blank">Valkyrian armor</a>, including the <a href="https://wiki.spiralknights.com/Divine_Avenger" target="_blank">Divine Avenger</a>, which was discussed to relate to a different armor from heavenly kingdom - the <a href="https://wiki.spiralknights.com/Heavenly_Guardian_Armor" target="_blank">Heavenly Guardian Armor</a> in [similarity of Isorians to valkyries](#similarity-to-heavenly-kingdom).

  This does not mean that Jelly civilization is involved into the Almirian conflict, nbt rather serves as a modern example of common practices within their kingdom. But we should keep in mind how sun silver is already being used and for what purposed, now with the addition of celestial ore, as both contain heavenly theme.

- `Superior plate mail forged from an alloy of several rare metals. its restrictive, but incredibly strong` (<a href="https://wiki.spiralknights.com/Ironmight_Plate_Mail" target="_blank">Ironmight Plate Mail</a>).

  What are those rare metals? From the currently present material, metals specifically, we can select a few:

  - <a href="https://wiki.spiralknights.com/Sun_Silver" target="_blank">Sun Silver</a>: `An extraordinary metal imbued with the radiant light of the sky`. It has a relation to heavens and the sun.
  - <a href="https://wiki.spiralknights.com/Perplexing_Element" target="_blank">Perplexing Element</a>: `A rare metal recovered from a shattered mountain deep within the realm of the Apocrea`. This metal does not seem to be related to the current case of Almire.
  - <a href="https://wiki.spiralknights.com/Shadow_Steel" target="_blank">Shadow Steel</a>: `An extraordinary metal imbued with the creeping darkness of the Underworld`. Although it was covered in relation to Underworld, this metal does not seem to be related to the current case, but may be potentially applied to <a href="https://wiki.spiralknights.com/Volcanic_Plate_Shield" target="_blank">Volcanic Plate Shield</a> and its symbol, as it will be discussed later.
  - <a href="https://wiki.spiralknights.com/Primal_Ore" target="_blank">Primal Ore</a>: `An extraordinary metal imbued with the savage spirit of the wild`. It is related to a few piercing-related gear, amongst which Kat Tribe equipment is notable, but as it is said to be extraordinary, it can be considered.
  - <a href="https://wiki.spiralknights.com/Volcanic_Iron" target="_blank">Volcanic Iron</a> is a potential candidate, as it is used for Volcanic Set, but not its shield, counterpart of Ironmight Shield - the <a href="https://wiki.spiralknights.com/Volcanic_Plate_Shield" target="_blank">Volcanic Plate Shield</a>. But, both volcanic and ironmight variants use rare samples of wood:

    - <a href="https://wiki.spiralknights.com/Redwood" target="_blank">Redwood</a>: `A sturdy chunk of fine, unfinished wood`.
    - <a href="https://wiki.spiralknights.com/Driftwood" target="_blank">Driftwood</a>: `A peculiar piece of wood that just won't stay put`.
    - <a href="https://wiki.spiralknights.com/Ironwood" target="_blank">Ironwood</a>: `A pristine log of one of the hardest substances known to the Spiral Knights`.

  All of those wood samples are directly used by in the alchemy of Ironmight and Volcanic armor sets and shields, suggesting presence of advanced enough technology to melt and use it. While those names are present in real world, here, we believe they are recontextualised to have a more fantasy-adjacent interpretation of fictional wood, most evident by the description of ironwood: `A pristine log of one of the hardest substances known to the Spiral Knights` (<a href="https://wiki.spiralknights.com/Ironwood" target="_blank">Ironwood</a>).

  Ironwood, which, through its name and description serves a very fitting role of the prime material used by the Ironmight kingdom for its properties explicitly seen to be utilized by the armor. We will return to those types of wood, plus a forth one, later in the context of gremlin operations.

  As for the point of melting and forging, <a href="https://wiki.spiralknights.com/Volcanic_Plate_Shield" target="_blank">Volcanic Plate Shield</a> states: `It is so resistant to high temperatures that its a mystery how exactly it was forged in the first place`, which might suggest that the skills were indeed acquired to work with nearing magical or elemental laws of the world. Notably, it is the <a href="https://wiki.spiralknights.com/Flame_Soul" target="_blank">flame souls</a> which is used in the alchemy of the volcanic set: `A powerful essence that left behind when a creature perishes during a blind, fiery rage` (<a href="https://wiki.spiralknights.com/Flame_Soul" target="_blank">flame souls</a>).

  Though this description does relate to a concept of rage, we believe that this is less of a connection with tortomega, but a universal concept of normal damage and rage symbolic connection. This, although might be a leap, may be suggested by normal-only defenses of the <a href="https://wiki.spiralknights.com/Volcanic_Plate_Shield" target="_blank">Volcanic Plate Shield</a> - that the Ironmight kingdom might have developed some skill in tempering elemental physics, to the point of discovering elemental damage and defenses.

- `A superior plate helmet forged from an alloy of several rare metals. It'll restrict your peripheral vision a bit but its virtually impregnable` (<a href="https://wiki.spiralknights.com/Ironmight_Plate_Helm" target="_blank">Ironmight Plate Helm</a>), as it was earlier covered in conjunction to ironmight set as a whole, its description suggests a compromise of vision in order to offer netter defenses.

##### Volcanic Elements

Volcanic Plate set - <a href="https://wiki.spiralknights.com/Volcanic_Plate_Mail" target="_blank">Volcanic plate Mail</a> has elemental defenses, but <a href="https://wiki.spiralknights.com/Ironmight_Plate_Mail" target="_blank">Ironmight set</a> has piercing defenses, a motif similar to Spiral Order, suggesting a lack of knowledge of other damage types due to, possibly, lack of encounters with such entities - such as lack of connection to Underworld. This scenario was already coveted with Isorians, and here we may observe a similar scenario. Based on this we propose a solution for both existence of both armors - that of an initial research of more magical aspects of the world. With Almire being located near the mountains with a deity's shrine inside: `Then one day he discovered a small cave that radiated with unnatural warmth, smelling of ash and sulfur. Within it he discovered a great chamber whose floor was waist deep in ashes. They were warm, and Vanaduke soon felt the sting of hot coals through his tattered boots. At the center of the chamber was a blackened shrine, whose deity's features were worn and indistinguishable. ... citizens of Almire watched as fire began to erupt from the mountains` (<a href="https://wiki.spiralknights.com/Firestorm_Citadel#Almire.27s_Fall" target="_blank">Almire's Fall</a>), - it is likely that even geographical position of Almire, its proximity to the mountains, was desirable by Ironmight kingdom in order to amass that elemental-infused gear, one that has some connection to fire. As the theme of fire is present in both cases, we can suggest a goal being creation of armor imbued with the <a href="https://wiki.spiralknights.com/Flame_Soul" target="_blank">flame souls</a> and forged of <a href="https://wiki.spiralknights.com/Volcanic_Iron" target="_blank">volcanic iron</a>, - the <a href="https://wiki.spiralknights.com/Volcanic_Plate_Helm" target="_blank">volcanic set</a> in the heat of those mountains.

It is here also it is important to note a relation between <a href="https://wiki.spiralknights.com/Flame_Soul" target="_blank">flame souls</a>, usage in <a href="https://wiki.spiralknights.com/Volcanic_Plate_Mail" target="_blank">volcanic set</a> and <a href="https://wiki.spiralknights.com/Volcanic_Iron" target="_blank">volcanic iron</a> - `An extraordinary metal imbued with the blazing energy of magma`. It may be speculated that the relation is based on the concept of flame souls being present within volcanic iron, giving it its elemental characteristics, notably, in the <a href="https://wiki.spiralknights.com/Volcanic_Plate_Helm" target="_blank">Volcanic Plate Helm</a>, which uses flame soul in alchemy, but volcanic iron in its description. Its glowing symbol can potentially be related to the glow of <a href="https://wiki.spiralknights.com/Gran_Faust" target="_blank">Gran Faust</a>.

Based on this, one parallel can be drawn here with the concept introduced in the [minerals and souls section](#minerals-and-souls-part-1) between mineral pillars potentially capable of trapping souls, with a prime example being everfrost and volcanic iron. We suggest, volcanic iron on some level has a relation to <a href="https://wiki.spiralknights.com/Soul#Fire_Soul" target="_blank">Fire Souls</a> and those being aggravated <a href="https://wiki.spiralknights.com/Flame_Soul" target="_blank">Flame Souls</a>, as flame souls are inherently linked to the Lord Vanaduke's curse and by proxy to the fire deity within the mountain.

To conclude, under the current thought framework of an empire, crowns are the single currency, shared across 3 kingdoms. Ironmight empire had skill relating to elemental damage, but to the point of full elemental defenses, apart from the volcanic set.

As for the Lord Vanaduke's search in the mountains, we relate back to 2 concepts:

- `A helm worm by heavenly guardians who watch over a kingdom hidden atop a magma-covered mountain` (<a href="https://wiki.spiralknights.com/Raging_Avenger_Helm#Storm_Avenger_Helm" target="_blank">Avenger's Helm</a>).
- `A helm worn by members of the Scarlet Scouts. Designed to frighten their enemies, this helm is in the visage of a fiend who lives in the mountains of a distant land. Said to guard the gate to heaven itself, it only allows those who are worthy to pass` (<a href="https://wiki.spiralknights.com/Oni_Helm" target="_blank">Oni Helm</a>).

Those mythological notions are not currently applicable to the context of kingdom of Almire, but we will keep them in mind for the analysis of Lord Vanaduke's encounter with the fire deity.

#### Almire and Spirit Mother

Almirian regalia is based on a medieval crown, most clearly seen on the <a href="https://wiki.spiralknights.com/Restored_Tapestry#Restored_Tapestry" target="_blank">Almirian Restored Tapestry</a>: a crown, through which grows a dark branching tree with red leaves and white wings at its roots. It can be confirmed that those are tree branches rather that black ironwork, based on the design of <a href="https://wiki.spiralknights.com/Crest_of_Almire" target="_blank">Crest of Almire</a>, wherein the black lines seem to behave as tree branches in relation to owns' shape and presence of red leaves. Despite being gear of Spiral Order, we lean for it here as an affirmation of the presented nature-themes Almirian design. The nature-themed designs are seen across <a href="https://wiki.spiralknights.com/Almire_Furniture_Box" target="_blank">all restored furniture</a>, reminiscent of water fountains of the Spirit Mother and <a href="https://wiki.spiralknights.com/Nature_Sprite" target="_blank">Nature Sprites</a>, suggesting a deeper and longer relation.

Those <a href="https://wiki.spiralknights.com/Nature_Sprite" target="_blank">Nature Sprites</a> have colored fur coat and furry striped ears not very similar to <a href="https://wiki.spiralknights.com/Dust_bunny" target="_blank">tier 3 dust bunnies</a>, in contrast to devoid of fur devilites. The fact that they are capable of being cursed, which restricts there power, they seem to be not related to the Underworld.

The union of Almire and Spirit Mother might be the reason why they would try to right Lord Vanaduke's wrongs (`I've heard that some kind of force of nature had once tried to right his wrongs but Lord Vanaduke imprisoned it somewhere within his fortress. Finding and freeing it may prove useful` - [Nature Sprite](<https://wiki.spiralknights.com/Lost_Soul_of_Almire_(nameless)>)). Moreover, this connection of the kingdom with Spirit Mother can be affirmed through the announcement of Almire Furniture Box: `Does your guild better commune with the Spirit Mother in her faraway realm?` ([Decorate your Guild Hall with the splendors of Almire!](https://forums.spiralknights.com/en/node/102786)).

Then there is the power of the water of Spirit Realm: `a force of nature summoned to this realm to extinguish the unnatural fire that is consuming it. ... Now none may proceed beyond the court as columns of shadow fire block all exits. Shadow fire can only be extinguished with the water that flows from these spirit wells. The water is the purest found in all of nature, flowing directly from the springs within the realm of the Spirit Mother herself` (<a href="https://wiki.spiralknights.com/Nature_Sprite" target="_blank">Firestorm Citadel - Nature Sprite</a>). This spirit realm was not encountered or mentioned of in any other place across Clockworks. But, there is one single instance of a place referred to as realm, and also refereed only 1 time - the Nameless Realm, described in the Chaos Cloak: `A forbidden mantle said to grant the wearer protection within the nameless realm where all elements are said to converge into one and divide into all` (<a href="https://wiki.spiralknights.com/Chaos_cloak" target="_blank">Chaos Cloak</a>). Although a speculation at that point, the fact that Nature Sprite does not name Spirit Mother's realm may be a potential reason to be the latter being named as such, nameless. It is important to note, that Chaos Cloak is an Owlite armor, and considering further analysis of Owlite and their advancements in elemental magic, might prove that this realm is indeed one and the same, despite their framed differences, discussed in the [Void section](#the-void) in the context of the Swarm.

#### Raiders and Pagan Vikings

The last of 3 kingdoms remains unknown. Here we decided to perform a logical leap, proposing that the third kingdom was based on a time period of viking invasions during 8 to 11 century. We suggest this mainly due to the following argument: existence of Raider Prize Box. Raider Prize Box is unrelated to the rest of in-universal history, and we attempted to analyze it is relation to Isorians with a presumption that those items are historically accurate to Isorian past, that they exist in confinements of the setting in the [spiral raiders section](#spiral-raiders).

Then there is case of total lack of any, even vague history of Isorians, apart from them being an ancient spacefaring civilization, which is also based on cosmetics, and the fact that they are at existential war with Morai. Both of those arguments play part in Isorian history already as an advanced civilization on cosmological scale, Kardashev scale, as one might refer to it.

Due to this, a sudden release of items, relating to Isorian past, when their entire history is virtually unknown, we believe that raiding equipment should, apart fom being Isorian, fit to a preestablished time period, one that is presented somewhere else.

We suggest that this period is the time when Almire existed and when it was at war with other 2 kingdoms, with the third kingdom being Isorian raiders. Here we might think of raider's equipment being designed with Spiral Order or an order of old insignia, but, we only saw the case of utilitarian, functional aspects of equipment being adapted by Spiral Order and not its cultural background. Further in we will proceed with an idea of Isorian Raiders being the second party, apart from Ironmight Kingdom during Almire's Fall.

As raiders were already covered in the [Spiral Raiders section](#spiral-raiders), [Spacefarers of Old](#spacefarers-of-old), and the [connection of Isorians and Cradle](#isora-and-cradle), within current context we believe that raiders, people of Almire, and Ironmight kingdoms were descendants of Isorians which had a connection with Cradle or its planets.

Raiders, of course, are inspired by popularized cultural aspects of Vikings, which might suggest a vague time period at which we can operate as well as place the events of Almire's Fall. By presence of <a href="https://wiki.spiralknights.com/Firestorm_Skeggox" target="_blank">Firestorm Skeggox</a> with an energy symbol we can confirm this inspiration and relation to Vikings. And, based on <a href="https://wiki.spiralknights.com/Squall_Caller" target="_blank">Squall Caller</a> we can guess that this period of raiding history relates to a period, to draw parallels, norse pagans, prior to their christianization and establishment of own territory to defend on the European mainland. This is seems to us important, as the weapon such as Squall Caller, does resemble Mjölnir, a hammer, serving both as a weapon and a tool for thunder god Thor of Norse mythology. At the same time, labeling them as a kingdom sets them, considering possible mainland location of Almire near mountains, as an already established, organized kingdom, which, in case of vikings happened only some time later. Although real history does not have a distinct event, dividing pre and post christianization vikings, as the pagan traditions did carry on, the design decisions for the equipment allow us only to hypothesize so far.

Apart from hat one small element was not earlier addressed - the key feature of mounted warden's head - <a href="https://wiki.spiralknights.com/Raider_Helm_Crest" target="_blank">Raider Helm Crest</a>. With the general depiction of a warden, one detail is out of place - the ears, or possibly, horns. Although we can't say for sure if it is the latter and not a change in ears' shape due to model itself, this can potentially mean something. Moreover, this element is depicted on the <a href="https://wiki.spiralknights.com/Raiders_Prize_Box" target="_blank">prize box itself</a>, as it is seen above warden's eye. Two possible suggestions we can come up with: leaning forwards ears are meant to symbolize alertness, considering raiders' lifestyle, and the other - a depiction of norse myth of Sleipnir, an eight-legged Odin's horse. Sleipnir he was capable of traveling across all nine realms of Norse cosmology, including realm of the dead.

The <a href="https://wiki.spiralknights.com/Firestorm_Raider_Helm#Firestorm_Raider_Helm" target="_blank">Firestorm Raider Helm</a> is described as `a pristine raider helmet, save for a few dings and a thick coat of ash`, suggesting that it became such after fall of Almire, as it burned, as well as continuous raids on it despite destruction of 2 kingdoms by Lord Vanaduke. Raiders did came from cold regions as seen by overall design. Nad based on the significance of the context behind firestorm, its usage, meant to be associated with Firestorm Citadel, we propose, that Raider, as their real world counterparts, came from norse seas, which allowed them to survive Lord Vanaduke's campaign from the mountains and come back to, now ashen, lang of former kingdom of Almire.

To conclude that part on a rather safe assumption, we propose, that Isorian Raiders are connected if not are the second kingdom of the two, which had invaded Almire.

Here we should also address a mythical trope of king being asleep in the mountains, and returning in a time of kingdom's strife. Of course, in the case of Almire this was subverted.

Considering many potential parallels and inspirations behind this setting we suggest that an approximate relation between kingdoms follows a pattern:

- Kingdom of Almire, being of celtic background and a nature or water goddess of Spirit Mother
- Spiral Raiders being pagans, as pre-Christianized vikings, yet they could have a land and own kingdom to defend as part of the setting.
- Ironmight Kingdom, being a powerful state, which in addition to raiders has managed to suppress Almire, with many inspirations leading to events somewhere around Norman conquest of England, and potentially Ireland.

As for the relation to Ireland, there is <a href="https://wiki.spiralknights.com/Lucky_Prize_Box" target="_blank">Lucky Prize Box</a>. Apart from being, of course, a prize box with cosmetics, it is the design of those cosmetics which we are interested in, apart from a notion of those themed items being present in gaming in general. But, as we will soon discuss, ancient Irish celtic traditions and culture have a potential of being related back to the kingdom of Almire. Of course, we have to keep in mind that the basis for those inspirations behind said kingdoms is not required in any matter to resemble any real-world event, but rather here we attempt to describe a method, which we used to better understand parts of the story which, although connected, remain vague.

##### Caladbolg and Irish Mythology

Major element of Almire's culture is based on its relation to water and Spirit Mother. As we lean to a potential timeline of raiders being in the similar time span as Almire and Ironmight, we suggest a potential relation to Irish kingdoms.

As it was pointed out earlier, raiders seem to belong to pagans, mainly due to their equipment with motifs from Norse mythology. It may be plausible for this instance of paganism being the alignment to ancient concepts of spiral and energy. As on the contrary, kingdom of Almire is aligned with the Spirit Mother. This concept of a connection can be vaguely seen in the Tuatha Dé Danann of Irish mythology. Tuatha Dé Danann were a race of divine beings and among them was the goddess Danu, who was associated with nature, fertility, earth and water. Danu also represents the fertile ground from which life springs and is associated with rivers and flowing water. This connection is seen in natural motif and designs of Almirian furniture, as well as with the water fountains of Almire whose water was taken from the Spirit Mother, capable of affecting the curse set by cursed Lord Vanaduke.

A possible connection to Ireland may be established through items of Lucky Prize Box, specifically <a href="https://wiki.spiralknights.com/Pot_O%27_Crowns" target="_blank">Pot O' Crowns</a> and <a href="https://wiki.spiralknights.com/Caladbolg" target="_blank">Caladbolg</a>, both dealing elemental fire damage. The latter item, the sword, seem to us important, as by the legends of medieval Irish mythology - Ulster Cycle - Caladbolg belongs to a king of Ulster. Another name for this kingdom is Ulaid, one of five kingdoms of Ireland on par with Munster.

#### Lack of Clockworks and Isorian Descendants

Another notion, despite relation to a different culture - in Wolver Dens a scenario room with a giant sword stuck in stone is located. The sword is said to have a star map engraved on it.

We suggest that this artifact relates to Spiral Raiders in a sense that they are descendants of Isorians, which had to end up on the different planet. This may also be seen as a potential link to Isorians already being familiar with the concept of energy, but ending up in a less technologically advanced state due to a possible event which had to cause it. As this is mainly a speculation, as no such recording event exists, we propose a scenario of Isorians being stranded on a planet which was at some point incorporated to Cradle. This and not landing on Cradle itself seems to us mainly dur to the fact that presence of CLockworks should then be recorder by, at least, people of Almire. Based on the position of Haven, Clockwork tunnels are not particularly deep below ground, although it is located near Arcade.

One anachronistic element here we have now to address - within the current proposal [gremlin confinements](#gremlin-containments), specifically elevators within Firestorm Citadel, are left ambiguous on the timeline, but, thee decision regarding them significantly affect Cradle's past. It lead to 2 scenarios: either being built by gremlins before Almire's Fall, leading to existence of Clockworks on that planet, defining it as Cradle, or were built later as a means of securing the Console behind throne room. The latter scenario suggest a plausibility of access by gremlins to the citadel, judging by the notion of gremlins guarding it. But, it is not impossible, and the lack of Clockworks being mentioned in Almirian texts seems to us as a strong point of suggesting that the events of Almire's Fall occurred prior to them being captured by the Core, and only later Console was supposed to be build there.

Here, we can attempt to establish the location of the Firestorm Citadel - based on it being the capital of Almire near the mountains, we can map it onto real world capital with consideration of Viking involvement.

Among few medieval Irish castles, we consider Firestorm Citadel being a stand-in for Rock of Cashel, located in the city of Cashel in Kingdom of Munster near the Galtee Mountains. Kingdom was invaded by Uí Imair's army of pagan Vikings. Near Rock was located a certain mountain - Devil's Bit. The legend says that the devil broke his teeth and spat the Rock of Cashel from his mouth to where it now stands. This parallels, although not in detail, <a href="https://wiki.spiralknights.com/Fang_of_Vog" target="_blank">Fang of Vog</a>, `a sword said to be created from the fang of the fire beast, Vog`, as it is alchemized from Almirian Seals, suggesting its involvement with Lord Vanaduke's curse.

Pembrooke, a spookat, is a reference to a city of Pembroke located in Wales. There a castle was build 1093.

#### He Brought Fire from the Mountains

Throughout Almire's war with neighboring kingdoms, Valkyries of heavenly kingdom had remained uninvolved. They did not intervene with the war, but, we suggest at some point, with the introduction of fiendish magic, they had to take measures. Those measure eventually resulted in the banishment of Legion of Ur into the Underworld. It order to draw the most probable timeline of events we have to recap an event, which would initially involve valkyries into the conflict, and that is how Lord Vanaduke fled into the mountains.

We can reason why valkyries haven't intervene, as in case of [Undercorp's erasure of Titans](#the-titans-tortomega-the-fall), and a plausible explanation could be one where event of this chapter had happened on a remote planet, separate from heavenly kingdom. But, there is existence of Owlites, who had surpassed valkyrian divine magic, and studied the kingdom of Almire. For now, we will consider both scenarios.

Here we will present the text of <a href="https://wiki.spiralknights.com/Firestorm_Citadel#Almire.27s_Fall" target="_blank">Almire's Fall</a> in its entirety as well as associated recounts of those events: `The Citadel originates from a war-stricken land of three competing kingdoms. The smallest of the three, known as Almire, was a land of lush, beautiful trees and golden fields. It was ruled by a young and determined king known as Lord Vanaduke, and, despite its small size, Almire was recognized as a powerful nation for its military tradition and disciplined armies. Given time, it could expand to a mighty empire. For this, the other two kings feared him and formed a truce to invade Almire. From atop the highest tower of the Grand Citadel of Almire, Vanaduke watched his kingdom crumble. His army was stretched too thin and it was not long before Almire would completely fall to the weight of the two combined armies. Going mad from the pressure, he fled from the citadel and vanished into the mountains, vowing that he would one day reclaim his throne. Leaving behind his family, his people, and his homeland, Vanaduke journeyed into the mountains to the east, driven by superstitious tales of ancient gods within their dark depths. He tirelessly searched the mountains for many years, no longer the man he was before, but a mad hermit. Then one day he discovered a small cave that radiated with unnatural warmth, smelling of ash and sulfur. Within it he discovered a great chamber whose floor was waist deep in ashes. They were warm, and Vanaduke soon felt the sting of hot coals through his tattered boots. At the center of the chamber was a blackened shrine, whose deity's features were worn and indistinguishable. Vanaduke began to whisper, reciting the names of his family, the names of the kings before him, and all the towns of Almire. He repeated this like a chant, increasing in intensity until he was shouting. With this he began screaming the names of the rival kings and all the wrongs they committed against his kingdom. He cried out to the god of the mountain to punish them, to give him the strength to take his kingdom back. In his frenzy he looked to the face of the deity and in it he began to see the face deform. The image burned into his eyes and brain like cinders, and contained that which sounded like the screaming of foreign tongues and war drums. With this, Vanaduke began to sink into the ash. He choked on the ash as it pulled him below, tasting sulfur his screams now sounding of roaring flames. Many days later the citizens of Almire watched as fire began to erupt from the mountains. Leading an army of terrible fiends, Vanaduke returned to his kingdom, destroying the occupied forces of the two opposing kingdoms in a single day. In time the two kingdoms fell, Vanaduke's legion burning everything in their path. When he returned to Almire, it burned as well, for everywhere he went, and everything he touched was doomed to ash. With nothing left to destroy, his legions left him and returned to the mountains, leaving the king to sit in his throne of ash and cinder, all the people of Almire dead around him. There the cursed king has remained since, ruling a burning kingdom from an ashen throne, surrounded by the lost souls of those that once served him. It is there that the king still mercilessly destroys any who dare enter his kingdom, however much the ashen shadow of what is was the rivers flowed with clear water and the leaves of the trees glittered like emeralds under the shining sun.`

Quoting [Nameless Lost Soul of Almire](<https://wiki.spiralknights.com/Lost_Soul_of_Almire_(nameless)#Dialogue>): `Lord Vanaduke brought the fire from the mountains to our kingdom. Everything burned. His enemies. Even his family. My family was lost too. I fled the battle as soon as I saw the wave of flames in the distance. I was able to reach my home just in time to see it burn. I don't even remember how it ended. I have no memory of my passing.`

Quoting <a href="https://wiki.spiralknights.com/Almirian_codex_text_Dialogue/Inner_Sanctum" target="_blank">Almirian Codex</a>: `Like so many of its people, Law and Order have fled Almire. Only Justice remains, but she too has been twisted by the cursed flames that ravage our kingdom. Justice is now the burning scepter of our once great Lord Vanaduke. Justice is swift, unflinching, merciless. My position has afforded me much in my life. I used to love the view that my tower offers. From these lofty heights I thought of myself as the first one to greet the spring season, the first to smell the life in the air as the flowers bloomed. Now only death and smoke hang in the air, even from these great heights. And the fires; the unnatural fires that seem to burn eternal, the fires that turn even the most pious men into horrible nightmares, I know that these fires shall soon take me as well. I will not give my former Lord the gift of my own life. It is not his to take, to twist. This shall be my final order. This shall be my Justice.`

This establishes a general timeline of events. Lord Vanaduke fled into the mountains, there he spent several years, Almire at that point was likely under control of the opposing kingdoms. Meanwhile in the mountains, Lord Vanaduke found a shrine to an unknown deity. It was located in a chamber, whose floor was of ash and burning coals.

This property of shrine's chamber design, with ash and coals present, of course, relates to fire. But this is unknown weather the mountain itself is a volcano or the unnatural warmth is delegated to only this chamber.

As Lord Vanaduke was last described being in the shrine, and as it is recounted by citizens of Almire that fires began to erupt from the mountains, it is likely that the shrine itself was the source of the fires, and a location from which Vanaduke's fiendish army had emerged.

The wall of flames described to come with Lord Vanaduke, suggest some magic similar to fire snakes. That same cursed fire was capable of transformation into "nightmares" - that seems to be the case of a few undead aligning with the Almire. Those undead are ones already discussed in the [crypts section](#crypts): <a href="https://wiki.spiralknights.com/Zombie#Slag_Walker" target="_blank">Slag Walker</a> and <a href="https://wiki.spiralknights.com/Zombie#Carnavon" target="_blank">Carnavon</a>, <a href="https://wiki.spiralknights.com/Almirian_Shadow_Guard#Almirian_Shadow_Guard" target="_blank">Almirian Shadow Guard</a>, and <a href="https://wiki.spiralknights.com/Almirian_Crusader" target="_blank">Almirian Crusaders</a>. Everyone but the first are related to the curse either through the design or ability to inflict it on Isorians.

Yet, it is not the original army of so called fiends which are stated in the text of Almire's Fall, suggesting that it came from the same shrine, yet likely immune to shadow fire, and differ from prior ones transformed by those flames. We will analyze them in relation to Underworld, as it will be later seen by the implied nature of the Blackened Shrine found by Lord Vanaduke in the mountains.

##### Blackened Shrine and Magma Deity

Before covering Lord Vanaduke's fiendish army, we must establish some connections with the Blackened Shrine itself. We suggest a name Blackened Shrine based on the text of Almire's Fall: `They were warm, and Vanaduke soon felt the sting of hot coals through his tattered boots. At the center of the chamber was a blackened shrine, whose deity's features were worn and indistinguishable.`

We have a candidate, one fitting both with fiery and curse themes of the deity of the shrine - the unnamed magma god, referred by the magma fanatics. It is seen by their design and description: `A plated mail said to have been worn by fanatics that worshiped a magma god. Its fires will protect those that are worthy.` (<a href="https://wiki.spiralknights.com/Magmatic_Fanatic_Mail#Magmatic_Fanatic_Mail" target="_blank">Magmatic Fanatic Mail</a>).

Spiral HQ has its own note on the deity, likely being the same: `Even more fun: by burning things while taking on the visage of a fiery deity of martial prowess` ([Fire GOOD!](https://forums.spiralknights.com/en/node/111013)). It is unknown, how Spiral Order regained this knowledge, but, based on the earlier discussed [Operation Gelid](#operation-gelid-and-other-methods-of-escaping-cradle), we can suggest that this case might be of similar nature, tracing back to Underworld's influence now onto Spiral Order.

The roster of items describes an entity, a suggested fanatic, who seems to possess a portion of this deity's power:

- <a href="https://wiki.spiralknights.com/Magmatic_Fanatic_Mail#Magmatic_Fanatic_Mail" target="_blank">Magmatic Fanatic Mail</a>: `A plated mail said to have been worn by fanatics that worshiped a magma god. Its fires will protect those that are worthy.`
- <a href="https://wiki.spiralknights.com/Magmatic_Fanatic_Mask#Magmatic_Fanatic_Mask" target="_blank">Magmatic Fanatic Mask</a>: `A mask said to have been worn by fanatics that worshiped a magma god. Its fires will light the path to victory.`
- <a href="https://wiki.spiralknights.com/Magmatic_Fanatic_Wings" target="_blank">Magmatic Fanatic Wings</a>
- <a href="https://wiki.spiralknights.com/Magmatic_Shackles#Magmatic_Shackles" target="_blank">Magmatic Shackles</a>

The design of fanatics' gear is reminiscent of celestial gear of ancient Isorians, but currently we can consider it only as a coincidence.

As for the general theme, as we covered [fiendish cults](#fiendish-cults), we suggest this one relating to the Magma Deity, and here we can safely suggest, that this deity's name is Vog.

It was established, that Vog is not a wolver, but the effects of this deity's power affect all living entities in the similar manner - this includes both Lord Vanaduke's transformation, magma fanatics and vog cubs, and the equipment made of the latter.

Lord Vanaduke resembles a fiery giant, while the rest of Almirians - Crusaders, Carnavons, and likely Royal Guards, are much less smaller in comparison. The case of guards being far larger than any SIsorian can be resolved with an idea of them being exactly for their size a formidable units in Almire's army.

Then there are vog cubs. There are no present sources of their resemblance, but, as based on the equipment, made from their hides - the <a href="https://wiki.spiralknights.com/Vog_Cub_Coat" target="_blank">Vog Cub set</a>, - they seem to also possess same volcanic characteristics, as only this set has the same blazing cracked pattern. The Vog Cub set being an upgrade of <a href="https://wiki.spiralknights.com/Ash_Tail_Coat" target="_blank">Ash Tail set</a> also allows us to draw parallels with <a href="https://wiki.spiralknights.com/Perma_Frostifur#Frostifur" target="_blank">frostifurs</a> and <a href="https://wiki.spiralknights.com/Perma_Frostifur#Perma-Frostifur" target="_blank">Perma-Frostifurs</a> as both in differing capacity seem to align to the Hail Deity, as discuss in the [influences of Underworld](#influences-of-underworld). The title of a deity - for the sake of simplicity, - we can attribute and to Vog as a continuation of the naming convention <a href="https://forums.spiralknights.com/en/node/9995#comment-55776" target="_blank">stated by Nick</a> - great fire beast Vog, - by the evidence of him possessing fangs - the <a href="https://wiki.spiralknights.com/Fang_of_vog" target="_blank">Fang of Vog</a>. It has the same cracked design while being constantly in flames, which, due to tricky nature of the deity, is also detrimental to its wielder. Finally, the <a href="https://wiki.spiralknights.com/File:Vog_Slippers-Equipped.png" target="_blank">Vog slippers</a> of the <a href="https://wiki.spiralknights.com/Cozy_Prize_Box" target="_blank">Cozy Prize Box</a> depict vog cubs as fire-themed wolvers with glowing muzzle and burning tail.

It is important to note that the heavenly kingdom is located above magma-covered mountains. Does this mean that the mountain in question is the same one the blackened shrine is located?

Through this, we now have to return to the nature of th mountain itself. We believe that the mountain in question, one that houses the shrine, is indeed a volcano by the following arguments:

- Presence of volcanic armor which utilizes volcanic iron as well as fiery souls - and as we discussed, both concept are not of material realm, by concept of souls.
- Inner Sanctum of Legion of Almire is most reminiscent of excavated remains of the city of Pompeii
- Aforementioned relation to fire deity and ashen remains of the legion may bring up a potential inspiration behind Vog, apart from being named such from volcanic fog, a concept of volcanic deity, specifically, roman god Vulcan. Vulcan is also associated with metalwork, which could be represented by the volcanic armor. Apart from Vulcan, a potential inspiration for the setting could be Japanese Fujisan Sengen Shrine located in the foothills of Mount Fuji. Not only it is located in the volcanic mountain, enshrining Kamuatatsu-hime - goddess of water keeping volcano from erupting, and is associated with water springs. Both volcanic and water themes are present in Almire, as well as fit into a potential geography of ALmire being located in the foothills with water springs from the mountain.

It seems plausible to us, that Almire, while it held power over land, and as it developed, it unearthed the volcanic iron and flame souls deep in the mountains. And, by being a medieval kingdom, one potentially aware of other realms, at least of Spirit Mother's realm, it is plausible for someone eventually to discover Underworld in the generally similar manner as Tortomega once did. Through those discoveries, kept within the mountain, armor forged from the volcanic iron was made, and at the same time a connection with Vog, which can potentially explain presence of both Blackened Shrine and Magma Fanatics.

##### Discovery of Vile Deity

We can also suggest that near this time an unknown Vile fiendish entity was found, as seen in <a href="https://wiki.spiralknights.com/Venom_Fiend_Mask#Venom_Fiend_Mask" target="_blank">Venom Fiend Mask</a>: `A mask said to be crafted in the visage of a venomous fiend. It is infused with a vile essence that is sure to frighten your foes`, and its similarity to the prior. While being mainly a speculation, it proposes an explanation for this similarity as follows: as Almire was at war, it can be plausible for the people of Almire to search for far more drastic measures in order to survive, and, as discussed in the [graveyards section](#graveyards), eventually someone would attempt to contact to the Underworld in some fashion, uncovering the Vile Deity. Which seems more possible if we take in consideration, that Lord Vanaduke had originally sought after the mountains due to a legend or a tale: `Vanaduke journeyed into the mountains to the east, driven by superstitious tales of ancient gods within their dark depths.` (<a href="https://wiki.spiralknights.com/Firestorm_Citadel#Almire.27s_Fall" target="_blank">Almire's Fall</a>). In that proposal, graveyards did remain the same, but the occult practices around them were now present.

The graveyards are present as the <a href="https://wiki.spiralknights.com/Legion_of_Almire/Necropolis_Grounds" target="_blank">necropolis grounds</a> where Almirian army was buried and contain <a href="https://wiki.spiralknights.com/File:Scenario_Room-Graveyard_1.png" target="_blank">Almirian tombs</a>, we can conclude, that they belong to the kingdom of Almire. Both the necropolis and tombs we can find lingering, seemingly devilite activity:

- Near the necropolis have an occasional <a href="https://wiki.spiralknights.com/File:Scenario_Room-Graveyard_variant.jpg" target="_blank">Almirian tomb</a> is found empty with shadow fires still burning in presence of cursed warrior
- In the necropolis, Devilite sigils and shadow fires are present near the tombs in the final arena of the <a href="https://wiki.spiralknights.com/Legion_of_Almire/Necropolis_Grounds" target="_blank">Necropolis Grounds</a>

But, as for whoever was drawing the sigils, we do not know. A potential lead in that regard, but one that seems more of an asset reuse - is presence of devilite sigil-like patterns on the Water Fountain in the court of the Firestorm Citadel.

#### Legion of Ur

It is stated that Lord Vanaduke had returned from the mountains with a fiendish army. The one army that seems to be otherworldly and made up of fiends is the Legion of Ur. But, how do they fit to the established timeline? Did Spiral Order take Legion of Ur as inspiration and a design for spiral wardens?

In the previous section we concluded, that fire deity Vog is essentially a fiend inhabiting the Underworld, and Lord Vanaduke is neither Undead nor a living Isorian, but a fiend-like entity seemingly animated by curse, which, considering presence of shadow damage and undead animated by his powers, is not native to the material realm. This makes us think of the many connections to the Underworld, proposing that Legion of Ur is that fiendish army, which Vanaduke led from the mountains, as the theme of a connection to it, both through Vanaduke and the fact no other powerful legion is currently known to exist seems solid enough reason to make that conclusion.

In the modern times Legion of Ur is sealed in the Underworld, we suggest that this legion was sealed as means of preventing any more large scale rampages, due to legion's immense manpower as stated: `Vanaduke returned to his kingdom, destroying the occupied forces of the two opposing kingdoms in a single day. In time the two kingdoms fell, Vanaduke's legion burning everything in their path.` (<a href="https://wiki.spiralknights.com/Firestorm_Citadel#Almire.27s_Fall" target="_blank">Almire's Fall</a>).

Setting aside designs of curse within Vanaduke, Darkfire Vanaduke, and nature of dark matter within trojans, we should point out the following arrangement of concepts - spookats and zombies do belong to different epochs separated by thousands of years. And yet, both ended up in the Owlite ruins of the High Academy, which is part of heavenly kingdom. Spookats are explained through a future war of Kat Tribe and Owlites, but presence of zombies is not. Moreover, summoned Black Kats are capable of summoning cursed Almirian warriors - Carnavons. This ties in with presence of undead in the academy.

We suggest that at some point in time, Vanaduke had a conflict with heavenly kingdom, wherein Owlites and valkyries were present. Graveyards, in that regard do belong to Almirian territories, as discussed earlier, by the presence of Almirian tombs.

This hypothesis may be also hinted by a specific wording in the monster codex - kingdom of Almire is referred by the monster codex of Lord Vanaduke in his Throne Room, as an Empire: `Little is known about the eternal Duke of the Almirian Empire.` ([Monstrous Codex: Lord Vanaduke](https://wiki.spiralknights.com/Vanaduke#About)). Could it be, that the kingdom of Almire did become an empire the size of the 3 warring kingdoms after Lord Vanaduke destroyed their armies - it was stated in the text of Almire's Fall (`It was ruled by a young and determined king known as Lord Vanaduke, and, despite its small size, Almire was recognized as a powerful nation for its military tradition and disciplined armies.` - <a href="https://wiki.spiralknights.com/Firestorm_Citadel#Almire.27s_Fall" target="_blank">Almire's Fall</a>)? At the same time the reference to Almire as an Empire only once could be an oversight. The possibility of this being an oversight may be also affirmed by the fact Lord Vanaduke had returned to the citadel: `With nothing left to destroy, his legions left him and returned to the mountains, leaving the king to sit in his throne of ash and cinder, all the people of Almire dead around him. There the cursed king has remained since, ruling a burning kingdom from an ashen throne` (<a href="https://wiki.spiralknights.com/Firestorm_Citadel#Almire.27s_Fall" target="_blank">Almire's Fall</a>).

##### Trojans

Prime thing to establish regarding trojans is to determine weather or not they are Isorian Spiral Wardens - as it is one of more lasting debates that tie in with the idea of Isorians being connected in some capacity to Cradle.

Trojans of tier 2 and deeper all have revealed bones, and, what is more important - horse skulls with jaws similar to apparitions of giant wolver of charged <a href="https://wiki.spiralknights.com/Wild_Hunting_Blade" target="_blank">Wild Hunting Blade</a>, <a href="https://wiki.spiralknights.com/Wolver#Perma-Frostifur" target="_blank">Perma-Frostifurs</a>, and <a href="https://wiki.spiralknights.com/Wolver#Void_Wolver" target="_blank">Void Wolvers</a>. This seems as an intentional design choice. And as anatomy, a horse skull, was taken in account, another example presents itself. This design notion culminates in tier 3 trojans, whose armor has depictions of skulls, and their internals, ribcage hidden behind chest plate seem to burn with purple flame. It is said that lazy devilites eventually transform into gorgos. Herein also lies Lord Vanaduke, by the fact of him being transformed, although by a curse, into an immortal fiery giant. Those notions are presented here as a matter of fact significant transformation while is rare, does exist as a concept. We can hypothesize that trojans are transformed Spiral Wardens, as under current framework, wardens had to end up on that planet.

Tier 1 trojans and the rest are explicitly seen as stone statues. In fact, trojans are encountered for the first time as statues in the Graveyard of Blades of The Fallen. Another instance is the Cryptic Statuary - a castle reminiscent of both Scarlet Fortress and Royal Jelly Palace with its pools of water in the courtyards while being located outside of the main mass of Scarlet Fortress, but with Scarlet Fortress tapestry remaining. Across all tiers, trojans have dark matter mineral embedded in their backs, and as depth increases, so its effects being more explicit. Notably, Tier 1 trojans have wooden armor, and considering there is existence of ironwood, we can suggest that it is redwood. The crest of their shields present on tier 1 trojans may potentially refer to Ironmight crest, mainly based of the idea that a tower depicted on all Scarlet Fortress tapestries is emblem of Heavenly Kingdom.

While the color is different the only other three instances of that type of burning being observed. Those are Carnavons, Darkfire Vanaduke and the <a href="https://wiki.spiralknights.com/Dark_Ember" target="_blank">Dark Embers</a>, which are `salvaged from Lord Vanaduke's throne room.` (<a href="https://wiki.spiralknights.com/Dark_Ember" target="_blank">Dark Ember</a>), and purple orbs of light across Moorcroft Manor and Shadow Firestorm Citadel.

Before making one rather significant suggestion with its implications regarding dark embers, we should cover <a href="https://wiki.spiralknights.com/Arkus" target="_blank">Arkus</a>, as a single Isorian, who seemingly bridges the gap between trojans and Spiral Wardens design-wise.

##### Arkus and Silent Legion

Apart from Spiral Wardens, <a href="https://wiki.spiralknights.com/Arkus" target="_blank">Arkus</a> is one that has a strong connection to trojans, although nature of this connections is unknown, it is one we should try to identify. This may potentially reveal more about trojans' nature.

Arkus is supposedly the only one surviving an attack of dust zombies with the rest of his squad perishing. This allows for an approximation of this ambush, being Graveyards, Clockwork Tunnels, Candlestick Keep, Ruined Compounds and Arenas. Considering that Arkus ended up in the Statuary, as he was called there, we can attempt to further analyze the likely location through different means.

Arkus' search and rescue mission - <a href="https://wiki.spiralknights.com/The_Silent_Legion" target="_blank">The Silent Legion</a>, - has several symbolic elements:

- The Silent Legion here is depicted as trojans while they are encased in stone, hence 3rd depth on the mission - Cryptic Statuary.

  This establishes as connection between trojan Legion of Ur and the Silent Legion of stone trojans. The distinction here, we believe, stems from the fact that LEgion of Ur is active and sealed in the Underworld, while the Silent Legion of trojans is present in the material realm. We don't know their motivation at that point, but few potential hints may be found - some statues in the Cryptic Statuary on hit become trojans, - this ties in in yet unexplored nature of trojans.

- First and second depths are "Poisoned Minds" and "Cold Hearts". This seems to us as most prominent symbolism in regards to the Silent Legion. If we to interpret this one, by reference to multiple minds and hearts, with a high certainty we can attribute it to the Silent Legion.

  Cold hearts are generally accepted as as <a href="https://www.theidioms.com/cold-hearted/" target="_blank">unfeeling or uncaring</a>. Trojans are turned to stone at that point, so it could be a metaphor for stone, as stone cold hearted.

  The prior is more nuanced - poisoned minds, it is not a singular mind, which in that case would mean Arkus, but it refers to the entire legion and maybe the way it affects Arkus, - by poisoning his mind. In case of legionnaires - who is the perpetrator, if we to read it literally?

  Considering presence of devilites, similar to how they were found in the Gauntlet during Shock and Awe, as well inside the penultimate arena during Last Stand, could it be, that devilites are indeed involved in the creation of the Legion? We believe that is true, considering that there is no other party powerful enough to perform such feats in relation to curses and haunting.

What happened to Arkus by the time Spiral Knights had met him? For that we have to analyze Arkus himself, and his dialogue.

- `I am drawn to this place. In the eyes of these silent warriors I see myself: cold, strong, unflinching... and crumbling. I have been asked to let it go, to move on, but this I cannot do. Their faces, their dying cries... they haunted me in my dreams, so I no longer sleep. Now I see them when I close my eyes, so I shall not blink. I will remain here, among the stones... never blinking, never forgetting.` (<a href="https://wiki.spiralknights.com/Arkus#Dialogue" target="_blank">Arkus - Recon Module</a>). From this entry we can establish basic premise of what has happened to Arkus since his squad had perished. Arkus is supposedly haunted by memory of his squad's last moments, and through this he was for some reason, drawn to the statuary.
- `I could swear I heard them just now, their voices carrying in the wind. No longer screams, no longer cries- whispers. Indecipherable even in the stillness of this place.` (<a href="https://wiki.spiralknights.com/The_Silent_Legion/Cryptic_Statuary" target="_blank">Arkus - Cryptic Statuary</a>). When Spiral Order caught up to him, he advised to leave him, and during the second encounter he told no more voices were haunting him.

Dark matter itself is stated to `contain the essences of both chaos and nothingness` (<a href="https://wiki.spiralknights.com/Mineral#Dark_Matter" target="_blank">Dark Matter</a>), this theme of madness from presence of dark matter, is described in greater detail in equipment as <a href="https://wiki.spiralknights.com/Acheron" target="_blank">Acheron</a>: `this dark weapon has been known to drive weak-minded knights to the brink of madness` and partially <a href="https://wiki.spiralknights.com/Obsidian_Edge" target="_blank">Obsidian Edge</a>: `A sinister sword made from the obsidian obelisks found within the realm of the Apocrea. Simply holding it makes you somehow feel guilty of an unknown crime.` Despite the latter being an eldritch brandish, both are initially alchemized from the nightblade.

As for the shadow damage itself, it is stated by <a href="https://wiki.spiralknights.com/Hahn" target="_blank">Spiral Order biotech Hahn</a>, that `shadow damage is generally caused by concentrations of negative energy. Attacks that inflict shadow damage include anything from the psychic manipulation of the aforementioned negative energy to physical attacks using weapons forged from dark matter.` (<a href="https://wiki.spiralknights.com/The_Shadow_Knows" target="_blank">The Shadow Knows - Hahn</a>). This property is similar to effects of dark matter-alchemized weapons, connecting the two. Considering the unreliability of Arkus as a narrator, it may seem unknown weather Arkus is haunted by the souls of his squad or is driven mad by the presence of dark matter, as there are no definitive evidence for the prior, and no cases of souls or spirits haunting living Isorians. Yet we can't deny the fact that spirits do return to material realm across Clockworks, and their effects on the material realm are rather vague, as well as they were seen in the material realm in such cases as Lost Souls during Shroud of Apocrea. Is the above scenario is true, - of Arkus being haunted - then this presents a scenario, in its uniqueness similar to the [Ghosts in the Machine](#ghosts-in-the-machine). And for the case of spirits remaining in the material realm, one item presents itself with the direct mention of haunting - the <a href="https://wiki.spiralknights.com/Dread_Skelly_Shield" target="_blank">Dread Skelly Shield</a>: `It occasionally issues a quiet, forlorn whisper, usually about remembering to block.` and its earlier version, <a href="https://wiki.spiralknights.com/Sinister_Skelly_Shield" target="_blank">Sinister Skelly Shield</a>: `A kite shield haunted by a benevolent ghost.` Those two items make us conclude on the scenario of Arkus being indeed haunted, and, as suggested by his reaction: `I have been asked to let it go, to move on, but this I cannot do.` ([Recon Module: Cryptic Statuary - Arkus](https://wiki.spiralknights.com/Cryptic_Statuary)) - where, we believe, Arkus refers to the spirits which haunt him.

Apart from those effects of dark matter, we need to establish a more defined nature of Arkus' physical state and relation to trojans through the analysis of other, more prominent effect of dark matter, and specificity, of curse. What are the conditions of Arkus' likely transformation to trojan, - is dark matter being here a consequence or means of the transformation? What part of this process is supposed to be symbolic in the first place, - for example, how Arkus is a Spiral Warden, has warden's horse helmet and trojans having similar horse appearance and a physical horse skull underneath the stone exterior of the helm as revealed in tier 2 and 3 trojan designs?

To resolve this, tortodrones could be reintroduced. They are reactivated with the dark matter crystals as a power source. In order to power tortodrone with dark matter, its shell is deconstructed, and on its plates fiendish sigils are carved in place of evil eyes, potentially made of dark matter due to their glow and other instance of ritual circles of dark matter. It was already explored, how devilites may use those sigils, concluding to them being a protective measure as suggested by the design similarity to a few Solomon's Seals. Tortodrones' case suggests that some intervention had to happen, in order to place dark matter. On the other hand, there are Lord Vanaduke, zombies and Carnavons, who got the familiar purple glow through the cursed transformation, mainly claws and inner glow of eyes and ribcage. In case of Arkus, as he is an Isorian, he could've gone through a similar process of potential death, as carnavons, or transfiguring curse, as Lord Vanaduke.

Here we have to bring up the case of devilite involvement, as they are usually ones responsible for Underworld-related activities across Clockworks. They are encountered in the Call of the Colossi as well as in the Amu-Sol during the event of Heart of Ice. They were present during summoning of trojans from the legion of Ur, and were present in the Gauntlet alongside gremlins. And despite all of those instances, they are absent in the Cryptic Statuary. From native fiends there are only <a href="https://wiki.spiralknights.com/Beryl_Greaver" target="_blank">Beryl Greavers</a> and trojans themselves. Greavers in that context are rather important entities. They have evil eye wing patterns, similar to moths, and in case of elemental greavers, those patterns glow. As it was already covered in the [Arrival of Undercorp section](#chapter-vi-arrival-of-undercorp), Greavers seem to be Underworld's military units, judging by the presence of a metal helm with a evil eye and the exact specie from which imagery of the evil eye started to spread across planet of material realm which was incorporated into Cradle.

What remains is their name. In a same manner as howlitzer are reminiscent of howitzers, could greavers be attributed to anything? First, there are greaves - a type of leg armour. This can potentially mean that greavers are the military units. We had suggested an inspiration behind greavers design being moths. Apart from a similar shape and wing patterns, they play a significant role in greek mythology. Moths were believed to be carriers or be guidance for souls. Apart from it, Arkus' fight is one of a few instance of a text or Spiral Knight narrating over the events: `An intense sadness radiates from his fallen form. His eys fade and a darkness washes over him. Arkus is lost.` (<a href="https://wiki.spiralknights.com/Arkus" target="_blank">Arkus - inspection</a>).

##### Minerals and Souls: Part 2 - Mineral Charge

Sparks of life, or rather, an emergency revive, supercharges dark matter shard in Arkus, forming small arcs of purple lightning on the first revive around the crystal, and on the second revive, those arcs are seen all throughout Arkus's armor. The last stage in that regard resembles tier 3 trojans, as both do have a characteristic purple burning and lightning, coupled with the presence of dark matter crystal. Arkus' dark matter shard now glows pink and burns with the same purple flame as trojans'.

This change found in mineral pillars seems to us as a depiction of its charged state, for the first time referenced in the [first part](#minerals-and-souls-part-1). This change in color here seems more plausible compared to color shift of tortofists, considering direct before and after states of Arkus' physique, as when compared to a depleted dark matter, Arkus is revived with pure energy of emergency revive, only then the burning, or fuming, of dark matter begins.

To cycle back to tortofists' ammo - there is potentially only other one instance of charged dark matter - the bullets of <a href="https://wiki.spiralknights.com/Gorgofist" target="_blank">Gorgofist</a>. In that case the crystals are the same color as pillars but have bright purple glow as the rest of tortofists' ammo.

Throughout [Minerals and Souls](#minerals-and-souls-part-1), [Auras and Souls](#auras-and-souls), and [Apocrean Engines](#apocrean-engines) we had suggested, that minerals under some conditions could contain charge of souls, essentially the Energy in a specific form - the Energy being the medium for souls to exist in and through, as pointer existed of linking souls to fuel. Most prominently, in case of Apocrean Engines. That energy is contained in minerals as charge, one used to power Clockwork Gates - as suggested by Vaelyn's team technician: `We need to analyze how mineral power affects the Core. The problem is that very little power reaches down to these depths. We can gather so much data from each gate as it launches`. This dialogue could potentially refer to an old method of gate construction, but, as dialogue itself remains in the game, and talks about gate launches themselves, we may also suggest a role of crystal energy here being used as-is - a component of the game, not intended to be removed as it sheds light on the actual physics of minerals, despite the latter being merged with the current concept of Energy.

As no souls exit minerals, unlike everfrost, it is likely that it is rather energy contained within those minerals. Or, as mineral pillars are explicitly placed and stored across Clockworks, we can suggest, those are in the depleted state. We can suggest such logic due to presence of dark matter in a more raw formations such as <a href="https://wiki.spiralknights.com/File:Area-Devilish_Drudgery-Scenario_Room5A.png" target="_blank">across dark cities</a>. Although those could be shards of tortodrone missiles.

Another link of Lost Souls and trojans being related is in the form of the <a href="https://wiki.spiralknights.com/Blades_of_the_Fallen/Soldier%27s_Graveyard" target="_blank">soldier's graveyard</a> of <a href="https://wiki.spiralknights.com/Blades_of_the_Fallen" target="_blank">Blades of the Fallen</a>. There, in the final arena both trojan statues are present, which at some point reanimate and lost souls.

Now we cycle back to tortodrones, but in the context of souls. What connects both them, trojans, and Arkus, is the fact that all have dark matter present, it serves as a potential power source, and is charged to the point of fuming:

- Tortodrones have cracks, lightning arcs and burning eyes all of purple color. Crimsonite-powered tortodrones don't have burning eyes, but do have red lightning arcs throughout their shell. Then a corrupted tortodrone is defeated, its power pistons extend and release purple mist, similar to mist of tier 2 trojans, albeit brighter, and petrify. Their shall are made of stone and capable of being completely destroyed.
- Trojans, especially tier 3 have their internals, ribcage and eyes, cracked and burning with the same purple flame and visible lightning arcs. Their dark matter crystal on the back burns as well and is the same bright pink color. When trojan is defeated, his crystal shatters, multiple purple explosions happen, and trojan petrifies.
- Arkus has the same dark matter crystal, with the first revive it glows with a small amount of pink purple lightning. With the second revive purple lightnings arcs traverse entirety of Arkus armour. When Arkus is defeated, no shattered crystal is seen, but the purple explosions remain. Arkus does not turn to stone.
- Maulos. He has the same armour with skull imagery, ribcage, and revealed skull for a head as tier 3 trojans. He has everfrost instead of dark matter embedded into him, and has moonstone-like glow from the ribcage, but no burning flames. What sets him apart from trojans is the spread of everfrost onto his skull from the chest, forming a spike. When he is defeated, the everfrost shard shatters with its distinct color.

All of those patterns seem to point a specificity of dark matter and everfrost, again, being connected but also having similar underlying nature and effects. To reiterate on [Minerals and Souls part 1 conclusion](#minerals-and-souls-part-1), this seems as one of arguments to affirming that souls in some capacity are contained in minerals. But then, this leads to questioning if everfrost is a subtype of moonstone, be it Underworld counterpart or a changed by souls of Blinding Abyss moonstone? This currently is unknown.

##### Metaphysics of Souls and Cursed Immortality

As zombies are resurrected, as Carnavons and Lord Vanaduke are animated by curse, which grants them immortality, what have happened to Arkus, and by extension, Maulos and the Legion of Ur to become fiends?

As far as information about Arkus claims, he could have metaphorically died back then and be brought back to life through curse, similar to the [crew of Iron Hulk](#ghosts-in-the-machine), as they haunt the ship and bodies as undead, or, more likely, as Lord Vanaduke on the altar of a volcanic deity. Apart from the transformation being caused by the sheer grief or exposure to Underworld may be a reason, we will keep it in mind.

In case of the [Ghost in The Machine](#ghosts-in-the-machine) the spirits, which could communicate, were benevolent. Trojans were sealed in the Underworld and then summoned, and Maulos is summoned from Underworld or even Blinding Abyss. Maulos brought influence of everfrost with him and is transformed by its presence when compared to trojans of Legion of Ur, who are transformed by the direct presence of dark matter.

Carnavons, potentially Slag Walkers, and the rest of Almire's legion were scorched by shadow fires of Lord Vanaduke, as well as Lord Vanaduke himself. This does not explicitly mean death, as souls of Almirians remain trapped, more about it now. In that sense, we suggest that presence of fiery souls after Firestorm Citadel' was partially cleansed by the waters from Spirit Mother's realm and Vanaduke's defeat, may reveal that they were trapped in a corporeal form of perished Almirians, in a similar manner as Lord Vanaduke is described by the [Lost Soul of Almire](<https://wiki.spiralknights.com/Lost_Soul_of_Almire_(nameless)>): `Lord Vanaduke rules over the citadel now. His soul bound to some horrific armored prison. ... Allow the souls he keeps bound to this world a chance to return` ([Alone in The Dark - Lost Souls of Almire](<https://wiki.spiralknights.com/Lost_Soul_of_Almire_(nameless)#Dialogue>)). That it is not the metaphysic of Cradle which do not permit his soul to leave, but the curse itself.

Souls are bound to the citadel, which burns as long as Lord Vanaduke is alive. The quote `His soul bound to some horrific armored prison` here, we believe, has 2 interpretations:

- Less of a reference to the citadel, but to Vanaduke's armor itself, as the armor itself seems unnatural, transforming with the Lord, and by presence of word "some", which in the context of the entire dialogue seems to us as a reference to a different object.
- Referring to the Citadel itself. Once Lord Vanaduke is defeated, Nature Sprites had regained power to put out the fire: `Firestorm Citadel continues to burn with accursed flames. Though the nature sprites have been steadily making progress in fighting the flames, something or someone has recently caused a violent resurgence in its destructive power` (<a href="https://wiki.spiralknights.com/Shadowplay" target="_blank">Shadowplay</a>). As the most of citadel is cleansed, the souls, mentioned n the quote `Allow the souls he keeps bound to this world a chance to return`, are present as <a href="https://wiki.spiralknights.com/Fire_Soul#Fire_Soul" target="_blank">Fire Souls</a> in the <a href="https://wiki.spiralknights.com/Shadowplay/Overgrown_Court" target="_blank">Overgrown Court</a>.

This setup and physics, on the other hand, contradict presence of souls in the [Dry Docks](#ghosts-in-the-machine). The problem, as we see it, stems from the fact souls of Almire are being released from the curse which had them bound to the citadel and its legion of undead, - this is what allowed them to transform into incorporeal lost souls - <a href="https://wiki.spiralknights.com/Fire_Soul#Fire_Soul" target="_blank">Fire Souls</a>. The fact that those souls contain element of fire may point to a type of containment they were in - here sealed by the Vog's or Vanaduke's fiery curse. In case of Heart of Ice <a href="https://wiki.spiralknights.com/Fire_Soul#Frozen_Soul" target="_blank">Frozen Souls</a> are as such due to being released from Everfrost, connecting them to the Blinding Abyss. Non-elemental Lost Souls of the graveyards are as such duw to more mutual process of resurrection - as they are not bound by the curse and are manifested through properties of Cradle which make spirits return to the material realm. But in case of the Ghost in The Machine - Static Souls are already released, despite them still inhabiting the circuits of the Skydome containing the vessel in the form of Dry Docks.

There, the same manner of haunting is present, and why souls would still exist in their unbound state, remains unknown, unless Underworld's presence of greater in that location, such as the case of graveyards. Although we do not know the reason for its prominent presence.

As for the <a href="https://wiki.spiralknights.com/Fire_Soul#Void_Soul" target="_blank">Void Souls</a> - we do have an explanation for them, which will be discussed in relation to the nature of Whitespace and Void later. Finally, Freed Souls were bound by the traps of Apocrea, which manifest in the properties of grasping plateau and metaphysics of harvester capable of manipulating souls. It is also there it is seen that Apocrean Harvester is capable of extracting souls from captured knights through the application of the purple beam of light. This process of extraction also damages the knight, - we see this as a direct link between the concepts of [Auras and Souls](#auras-and-souls) and currently established metaphysics of Energy and Souls. Although Auras in that regard remain mostly unknown, the nature of this connection between all of the above concepts seems here evident, potentially even, as different manifestations of the same base concept of Energy. This will later tie in with the concept of base matter, or Prima Materia in the context of alchemy, but, this motif will be also analyzed in the context of the rest of alchemical motifs yet to fully cover. Until then this concept should be kept in mind.

##### Arkus: The Design

Could it be that only death causes loss of consciousness but in case of Arkus, Lord Vanaduke, and potentially Maulos, they preserve it, despite going mad or delirious, implying someone being responsible for this state directly, such as Underworld deities?

This connects to each individuals' powers, as Arkus, despite being partially a trojan and a fiend, has orbiting dark orbs, similar to Vanaduke. Those dark orbs are also seen in Warmaster Seerus' anti-gremlin bomb, Dark Retribution, and <a href="https://wiki.spiralknights.com/Neutralizer" target="_blank">neutralizer's</a> shots. Apart from that, as here we won't analyze gremlin technology, what else connects the two? Both were grieving, which may also play part in their transformation. At the same time, as this topic is directly linked to deific presence, Vog explicitly transforms vog cubs, as <a href="https://forums.spiralknights.com/en/node/9995#comment-55776" target="_blank">stated by Nick</a>: `The great fire beast Vog isn't a wolver himself, but a fiery deity of sorts who embraces some creatures and grants them a bit of power. Vog's 'cubs' are more or less acquired and forced to spread his fiery love across the world`, despite Vog cubs being currently absent in the game.

Lastly, Arkus' sword slam attack has pink lightning strike from above, and forms dark crimsotine shards. Those depleted crimsonite shards are the same as tortodrones'. The pink lightning strike may be similar to the one present during summoning of Margrel. We will kee in mind as an odd, but common design choice.

Arkus's transformation may potentially tie in with the discussed earlier location of dust zombie ambush and influence of Underworld. And the fact that Cryptic Statuary, apart from housing stone trojans, belongs seemingly to heavenly kingdom and explicitly by the elevator icon. In that regard, we can speculate that the location of ambush is related to trojans and their transformation - relation to that period in time. This time period seems to us a one when Lord Vanaduke supposedly invaded heavenly kingdom, but with fiendish army remaining relevant. This may lead to 2 candidates, as we see it: Clockwork Tunnels, as the Statuary is in the tunnels, and Graveyards, - as both have dust zombies, but the latter has only dust zombies without any status effect. As for the red lighting and crimsonite shards - currently those remain unknown, as nothing seem to come close to such attack pattern or design. But, due to aforementioned relation to Margrel and yet not analyzed nature of <a href="https://wiki.spiralknights.com/Dread_Seal" target="_blank">Dread Seals</a>, we may try to return to this question.

##### Dark Matter as Manifestation of Curse

As Lord Vanaduke was granted immense power and cursed immortality as he asked to destroy enemy kingdoms, we suggest the same be told of trojans, spiral wardens of medieval age, as seen by tier 1 design.

But, to compare with Lord Vanaduke, trojans, in this framework seem to be the result of a large scale process of curse, transforming into horse-like beasts, with their armor turning to stone, while retaining some features, seen even in the modern Spiral Order. But the difference lies in the process itself - while Lord Vanaduke's transformation seems to be gifted to him by Vog, that is unknown of Trojans, as well as of Arkus. As discussed in previous section - it is unknown, what are the conditions which allow for the curse to take affect, transforming its bearer.

But exactly here lies the basis of our proposal. Lord Vanaduke, and Darkfire Vanaduke have respective similarity to Slag Zombies and Carnavons by the fact of transformed claws - those are the result of the transformation. And for trojans, their position and role as defenders twists them in the same thematic manner - as they become wardens, but as a fiendish army, invincible from the front, and vulnerable from the back.

If we attempt to apply logic behind Almirians' transformation, then crystal of dark matter becomes the manifestation of the curse. In case of Lord Vanaduke that manifestation of the curse was his claws and the mask, which seems to have a mind of its own, but also has a small red gem in the forehead - but this is a different topic.

Then this suggests that trojans had to become fiends prior to Vanaduke's curse, until then remaining in Underworld. As they were rampaging, this has to be the reason severe enough for heavenly kingdom to intervene.

At that presence of <a href="https://wiki.spiralknights.com/Ancient_Grove" target="_blank">monitors on the grim gates</a> seemingly implies the connection of gremlins and devilites established in <a href="https://wiki.spiralknights.com/Work_for_Idle_Hands" target="_blank">Work for Idle Hands</a>: `Analysis of the data collected from these offices indicates that devilite corporations are outsourced by gremlins in order to design and manage various projects that include weapons specifically engineered to target Spiral Knight squads`.

One another concept we found interesting, is the thematic element of petrification in the context of eldritch mythos, specifically, their predecessor, the King in Yellow, mentioned in relation to Apocrea. In the King in Yellow, the short story of "The Mask" had the element of petrification, wherein any object submerged into a mixture would turn too marble with a pink inner glow, and after a while returning back to its natural state:

`He held the lily toward me, and I took it in my hand. It had turned to stone, to the purest marble. The marble was white as snow, but in its depths the veins of the lily were tinged with palest azure, and a faint flush lingered deep in its heart. ... But if you held it to the light the stone was beautifully veined with a faint blue, and from somewhere within came a rosy light like the tint which slumbers in an opal.`

This reminds us of the Cryptic Statuary, and potential reasons for its establishment. Herein we also should point out dark matter crystal burning, similar to the rays of light present in alchemized, as stated by Alec, marble:

`"There is one thing I'm curious about," I said, "and that is where the ray of sunlight came from." ... "It looked like a sunbeam true enough," he said. "I don't know, it always comes when I immerse any living thing. Perhaps," he continued, smiling, "perhaps it is the vital spark of the creature escaping to the source from whence it came." ... I laughed too, and told him I was devoured by the desire for gold, and we had better talk of something else; so when Genevieve came in shortly after, we had turned our backs on alchemy.`

The reason we brought up this story here is the earlier idea of poisoned minds and cold heart as the depths' names of Silent Legion mission. Where this lead could arrive, we do not currently know, but it would not be of detriment to point out this general theme.

#### Nature of Darkfire

While we will not touch upon Shadow Lairs, what important in that regard is to analyze nature of Darkfire, as it is associated to the most cursed location currently. We will attempt to find connections to the metaphysics of souls and minerals, and specifically nature of curses in material realm.

It is stated that Darkfire Vanaduke became such due to an unknown powerful curse falling onto the firestorm citadel: `A powerful curse has overtaken the Firestorm Citadel, transforming its hordes and lead by the mighty Darkfire Vanaduke!` ([Release Notes: 2011.10.19](https://wiki.spiralknights.com/Release_Notes_2011-10-19)). This curse is manifested most prominently in the different transformation of Lord Vanaduke, pink glow of volcanic chamber, and presence of Carnavons. All affected by the curse. Carnavons in that matter serve as a link of this curse being the same as one taking effects on Isorians in the form of the curse status effect.

Black Kats, mentioned in relation to Auras in the [Auras and Souls section](#auras-and-souls), also have this capacity to inflict curse, and all having the <a href="https://wiki.spiralknights.com/Dread_Seal" target="_blank">Dread Seal</a> with an image of evil eye, which links to the Underworld.

This curse also exists outside of Shadow Lairs as Carnavons are summoned by Black Kats across Clockworks. Carnavons' blackened crests have same purple cracks instead of fiery ones, similar to trojans, but the latter are incapable of inflicting curse, and only Carnavons have inscribed curse symbol of their Almirian Crests.

Lord Vanaduke became an immortal giant after his initial transformation by, supposedly, Vog - it is stated that Firestorm Citadel has been burning for thousands of years. We know that Lord Vanaduke has power over flame souls and his mask, to which we will return soon, has another flame soul, behaving as a standalone entity, and stated as being Lord's source of power (`Our sensors show the mask is a source of power as well as a potential weakness` - [Monstrous Codex: Lord Vanaduke](https://wiki.spiralknights.com/Firestorm_Citadel/Throne_Room)). There is also armor, which seems to be transformed with the wielder itself, having large chains holding it together, similar to a cage.

Finally, <a href="https://wiki.spiralknights.com/Dark_Ember" target="_blank">Dark Embers</a> can be made without descending into the Shadow Lairs. <a href="https://wiki.spiralknights.com/Dark_Ember" target="_blank">Dark Ember</a> description states: `A mote of burning energy salvaged from Lord Vanaduke's throne room. It slowly smolders with a sinister intensity, creating an almost hypnotic trance when gazed upon for any length of time`.

Another instance of purple flame is seen across Moorcroft Manor in floating fire bowls. Weather it is the same as the dark ember is unknown, but it would plausible.

This factors make us think of Vog's curse being still unfamiliar to Spiral Order, only seen experienced directly through the properties of <a href="https://wiki.spiralknights.com/Fang_of_Vog" target="_blank">Fang of Vog</a>, while curse status effect represents a greater Curse, a more widespread. Despite this, both of those curses originates from the Underworld and are capable of trapping souls and inflict undeath onto creatures of material realm.

This can be further affirmed by the description of Citadel being cursed, as if the curse was applied externally, rather than an emergent property of the prior. This fit with the design of Carnavons, as they have a crudely drawn curse symbol drawn on their Blackened crest - someone had to draw it. But, it is unknown weather the mark, of the dread seal is the source of curse. Then, by the fct of Citadel being cursed, we can suggest, that Slag Walkers became Carnavons through this curse.

Not all members of legion of Almire are burning in darkfire, leaving crusaders and royal guards as ones transformed through Lord Vanaduke's initial arrival from the mountains.

Those factor seems to us as a bridge between this type of curse and dark matter. Darkfire could be in that context a unique phenomenon emerging from Underworld fire's - shadow fire. Then, is Shadow Fire the same phenomenon as Darkfire? While Shadow Fire had its redesign, darkfire is explicitly purple and remained as such. As far as we can be aware, there are multiple sources of purple fire, including burning dark matter.

This leaves us with 2 explanations:

- Darkfire is the same fire that accompanies trojans of tier 2 and 3, as well as Arkus, and fire bowls of Moorcroft Manor, and Shadow Firestorm Citadel. This assumption is based on prior design similarities across all of those subjects.
- Darkfire is the result of 2 curses merging - giving to Vog's fires this curse-bearing property, different from a transformative curse, as one seen across Legion of Almire. And, as this purple-coded curse seems to be far more widespread and as only it has the connection to the evil eye, and adopted it as its symbol among Spiral Order, and as presence of Underworld's cultural imprint in case of Tortomega.

  Another argument fot this explanation is based on the design of fire souls of the Darkfire Vanaduke's mask - no such color is present across Cradle so far, combining both fiery aspect of Lord Vanaduke, but also being color-coded and curse-bearing element. This orb of fire, in fact, could be the very dark fire, distinct from dark embers, which are explicitly purple.

Considering many instances of unreliable narrators so far, even with cases such as Nameless Realm, while is named once, darkfire, due to Vanaduke's mask argument, seems to us as a distinct phenomenon.

Keeping that distinction in mind, we will later attempt to apply common properties of curse to Black Kats of the Kat Tribe. With this, we have to return to nature of the curse, as of now we propose that both of those curses have underlying common nature, emerging from the Underworld, as well as its deities.

Vog's curse can curse gives the curse-bearer power to exist beyond regular laws of their species, the case of Isorians it is Lord Vanaduke. He had transcended ages while being bound to the armour, and capable of upholding entire citadel in stasis, with his mask being important to his state.

Maulos, transformed by everfrost, seem to have retained mind of his own, compared to rest of trojans. He is capable of frost magic affecting an entire fiendish city. He is also a fiend, same as the rest of trojans. And as trojans were already covered, we believe that the curse in question can manifest differently depending on it' application, resulting in different effects and magnitude, but inevitably tracing back to the Underworld and greater understanding of nature of shadow damage.

##### Vanaduke's Mask and Immortality <span class="through-curse">Through Curse</span>

When dark matter crystal is shattered, trojan petrifies, he can potentially be reanimated from stone, but it was not ever seen. As a matter of fact, trojan petrifies. If we take into account similarity of Arkus and other trojans, we lean to a conclusion of trojans being transformed by the curse, which manifested as dark matter, and housed their souls.

The exact nature of Blackened Shrine is unknown, although, as it is very likely a fiendish device, we can suggest that it might be similar to grim totems, which are the only fiendish objects, capable of resurrecting zombies from their own skulls. Could it be as the skull is the remaining part from which resurrection is performed? And if so, could similar principal be applied to Lord Vanaduke's mask, as it is stated: `Our sensors show the mask is a source of power as well as a potential weakness` ([Monstrous Codex: Lord Vanaduke](https://wiki.spiralknights.com/Vanaduke#About))?

Lord Vanaduke's mask seemingly lives on its own, while Lord Vanaduke is invincible. Notably, the mask on its inner side has a flame soul or darkfire soul. In first case it is the same as ones observed to be orbiting Lord Vanaduke after initial damage to the mask. The second case is, as described earlier, makes it unique.

When mask is damaged enough, it returns to its owner in as a fiery soul, exploding on contact, which seems to be unpleasant for the Lord. We believe that this is Vanaduke's soul most present. This can be reaffirmed by the fact that only his orbiting fiery orbs have eyes, but are referred as flame souls, likely similar entities found as a material - <a href="https://wiki.spiralknights.com/Flame_Soul" target="_blank">Flame Souls</a>: `A powerful essence that left behind when a creature perishes during a blind, fiery rage`. The same proposal we made, when analyzed the meaning behind Lost Souls of Almire quote: `His soul bound to some horrific armored prison` ([Alone in the Dark - Lost SOul of Almire](<https://wiki.spiralknights.com/Lost_Soul_of_Almire_(nameless)#Dialogue>)).

Compared to trojans, on defeat, Vanaduke's body completely burns up, with only his scepter remaining. But, as evident by later alchemized <a href="https://wiki.spiralknights.com/Lord_Vanaduke%27s_Mask" target="_blank">Mask</a> and <a href="https://wiki.spiralknights.com/Lord_Vanaduke%27s_Finery" target="_blank">Finery</a>, something had remained of him:

- <a href="https://wiki.spiralknights.com/Lord_Vanaduke%27s_Mask" target="_blank">Vanaduke's Mask</a>: `The sinister mask formerly worn by Vanaduke, Lord of the Firestorm Citadel. its far too big for a knight to wear`. It is alchemized with the usage of <a href="https://wiki.spiralknights.com/Soul_Dust" target="_blank">Soul Dust</a>: `The dust of the departed. Whether it still retains any shred of a soul remains to be seen`.
- <a href="https://wiki.spiralknights.com/Lord_Vanaduke%27s_Finery" target="_blank">Finery</a>: `An artistic arrangement of Lord Vanaduke's mask, armor and scepter. It represents the folly of greed, the agony of despair, and how awesome fire and spikes look together`.

Mask's description suggest that in was taken of the Lord after the events of the King of Ashes: `The sinister mask formerly worn by Vanaduke, Lord of the Firestorm Citadel. its far too big for a knight to wear` (<a href="https://wiki.spiralknights.com/Lord_Vanaduke's_Mask" target="_blank">Lord Vanaduke's Mask</a>). Based on this, we lean to an explanation, that in canon timeline, the mask was indeed salvaged, as for the resourced required to alchemize it - they do expand on the state of the mask itself.

The presence of remains of Vanaduke's souls can be identified by the themes of equipment alchemized with the Soul Dust, specifically the case of <a href="https://wiki.spiralknights.com/Skelly_Shield" target="_blank">Skelly Shield</a> alchemy line. This line of shields was touched upon when we analyzed truthfulness of Arkus's haunting, concluding on it being valid. Here we delve into alchemical materials for those items, as their presence both for the Mask and the Finery is very specific. The <a href="https://wiki.spiralknights.com/Sinister_Skelly_Shield" target="_blank">Sinister Skelly Shield</a> is the first one to specify presence of ghost - `A kite shield haunted by a benevolent ghost`, - at the same time as <a href="https://wiki.spiralknights.com/Blighted_Bone" target="_blank">Blighted Bone</a> is presented into its alchemy. The <a href="https://wiki.spiralknights.com/Scary_Skelly_Shield" target="_blank">Scary Skelly Shield</a>, a 3-star item, is the first to use Soul Dust, but has no mention of haunting: `A small, spooky shield to safeguard you from shadow`. This tells one thing to us: Soul Dust is not the source of haunting, but blighted bone is the material which ultimately results in spirit binding to an object, likely with the assistance of the Soul Dust and Grave Soil.

This concept can be applied to the distinction between Lord Vanaduke's Mask and Finery, with the latter being seemingly haunted by his presence though burning eys of the mask. Finery is the one utilizing <a href="https://wiki.spiralknights.com/Blighted_Bone" target="_blank">Blighted Bone</a> in its alchemy. This may not explicitly mean, that the departed Vanaduke's souls is rebound, but some ot its image remains, as specified by the <a href="https://wiki.spiralknights.com/Soul_Dust" target="_blank">Soul Dust</a>: `The dust of the departed. Whether it still retains any shred of a soul remains to be seen`.

As for the design of the mask, one element we mentioned several times was the red gem embedded into the mask. Across cultures such symbolism is usually referred to the Third Eye or a connection to otherworldly forces. In case of Lord Vanaduke, we would argue that the mask is manifestation of the curse and is the face of the deity by the reasoning that Almirian Armor remains similar to Spiral Order in its medieval designs, and presence of unconventional elements is rare. The only close case of similar themes are the <a href="https://wiki.spiralknights.com/Oni_Helm" target="_blank">Grim Mask</a>, <a href="https://wiki.spiralknights.com/Grim_Mask" target="_blank">Grim Mask</a> and <a href="https://wiki.spiralknights.com/Diablo_Helm" target="_blank">Diablo Helm</a>, but all of them preserve general Spiral Order designs. This may be potentially affirmed by the design of the spike-like jaw, as in cases of <a href="https://wiki.spiralknights.com/Authentic_Phantom_Mask" target="_blank">Authentic Phantom Mask</a> <a href="https://wiki.spiralknights.com/Grim_Mask" target="_blank">Grim Mask</a> and <a href="https://wiki.spiralknights.com/Fiend_Mask" target="_blank">Fiend Mask</a> all of them referencing a skull.

While this may serve as a closure for Almire, Legion of Ur, which we suggested to be the fiendish army led by Lord Vanaduke, remains unsolved, despite potential reasons for their transformation. We had proposed them being formed before kingdom of Almire, as former Isorian Wardens. They would outlast Almire and it is how they became sealed we must discuss next.

#### War of Heavenly Kingdom and Underworld

After assisting Lord Vanaduke trojans returned into the Underworld.

Heavenly kingdom up to that moment was not affected by Vanaduke's crusade. But, based on the following items we have evidence of a past conflict between Valkyries and Underworld:

- `Its golden frame was believed to provide light within the impenetrable darkness of the Underworld` (<a href="https://wiki.spiralknights.com/Gilded_Griffin" target="_blank">Gilded Griffin</a>), - Gunslingers, which we wll discuss soon, have descended into the Underworld, and saw it. At the same time, they have advanced technology and magic to allow creation of the handgun. At the same time, they knew of draconic designs, here referred as griffins, based on name, and design of dragons on the barrel. At the same time, griffin may refer to the apparition of griffin during charge shot of the gun.
- `A holy sword created in another time to arm knights who fought against the legions of the Underworld` (<a href="https://wiki.spiralknights.com/Avenger" target="_blank">Avenger</a>) and the <a href="https://wiki.spiralknights.com/Divine_avenger" target="_blank">Divine Avenger</a>: `An upgraded Avenger formed from the purest sun steel. There are few foes remaining in this world that are worthy enough to be defeated by such a fine blade, and there are still fewer heroes worthy of wielding it`. Those have similar designs to the <a href="https://wiki.spiralknights.com/Heavenly_Guardian_Armor" target="_blank">Heavenly Guardian Armor</a>, which does look like one belonging to knights if judged by, for example, <a href="https://wiki.spiralknights.com/Heavenly_Guardian_Helm" target="_blank">Heavenly Guardian Helm</a>.

Of course, handgun and sword may belong to a different eras, as they don't seem to thematically connect at any point, apart from the fact both had seen Underworld and were there.

Taking this in consideration, items made of undead of fiendish material should be pointed out. During that undefined period of time and Underworld materials were acquired, <a href="https://wiki.spiralknights.com/Heavenly_Iron_Helm" target="_blank">Heavenly Iron Helm</a> and <a href="https://wiki.spiralknights.com/Chaos_Cloak" target="_blank">Chaos Cloak</a> were made. We group those based on the preconception, that valkyries and Owlites are the same species. This concept will be covered shortly.

##### Owlites and Valkyries of Heavenly Kingdom

It is important to address the lingering inconsistency of the species of the heavenly kingdom, that is - what are valkyries?

Valkyries were the heavenly kingdom's army as suggested by <a href="https://wiki.spiralknights.com/Angelic_Helm" target="_blank">Angelic Helm</a>: `A beautiful helm made to resemble a heavenly guardian`. The kingdom, as it was discussed, was located on the grounds of what later became the Scarlet Fortress. As the kingdom is already capable of flight, we can suggest that it was already flying prior to Clockworks, as suggested by the <a href="https://wiki.spiralknights.com/Avenger_Helm" target="_blank">Avenger Helm</a>: `A helm worm by heavenly guardians who watch over a kingdom hidden atop a magma-covered mountain`. This makes it implicit as well as thematically fitting for the inhabitants of the kingdom being an avian species, and here both valkyries and Owlites could fit.

While valkyries were covered as ones inspired by norse mythology, their anatomy remains unknown. And, as for Owlites, <a href="https://wiki.spiralknights.com/Owlite_Robe" target="_blank">Owlite Robe</a> heavily implies their upper limbs used to be wings or seemed as such, while capable of grabbing. On the contrary, valkyries could have had wings on their backs, as suggested by the design of <a href="https://wiki.spiralknights.com/Valkyrie_Wings" target="_blank">Valkyrie Wings</a> and [a raiment](<https://wiki.spiralknights.com/Raiment_(Costume)>): `A long, flowing battle garb best accessorized with a pair of angelic wings`.

##### Gunslinger Priests

There exists a griffin-like specie, as described by the <a href="https://wiki.spiralknights.com/Gilded_Griffin" target="_blank">Gilded Griffin</a>: `A beautiful pistol named after a great, noble beast. Its golden frame was believed to provide light within the impenetrable darkness of the Underworld`, yet, on the handgun itself there are dragons depicted and only <a href="https://wiki.spiralknights.com/Argent_Peacemaker" target="_blank">Argent Peacemaker</a> and <a href="https://wiki.spiralknights.com/Sentenza" target="_blank">Sentenza</a> alchemy paths have a creature with a beak.

This further distinction of dragons and griffins may be important, as is dictates the purpose of the handgun, but also the symbolic aspect of the creature, with with the purpose is associated. <a href="https://wiki.spiralknights.com/Raptor" target="_blank">Raptor</a>, a predecessor of <a href="https://wiki.spiralknights.com/Gilded_Griffin" target="_blank">Gilded Griffin</a> is also designed specifically to venture into the Underworld: `An ancient pistol imbued with enchantments designed to smite the fiendish creatures of the Underworld`.

The key 2 elements of this branch of Antigua alchemy tree are draconic design and direct creation of the handguns to fight fiends of the Underworld as observed by the pure piercing damage and description. Those who wielded it did see the underworld and likely, were present while griffins existed in rer to assign them those characteristics, as their exact properties are then reflected in the gun and linked with the Underworld. In that regard, the change from raptor to griffin may be due to a reason, currently unknown. Dragons were seen under the current theory only by valkyries and Isorians and those two civilizations are the only candidates to be creators of those guns. Here we must note of a similar design in the Knight's battle sprite stats menu, where in its food slot is located between 2 dragon heads, the same as the arches of the floating castles, belonging to heavenly kingdom. This similarity in designs should not be ignored, and is one argument to propose a hypothesis that both civilizations are the same biological specie or at least are related. It is currently unknown, but the possibility should not be discarded. This notion, although an uncommon one, should be kept in mind for the analysis of Owlite skills and advancements in relation to their understanding of elemental damage.

Then there are Antigua upgrades with imagery of a bird:

- `these handguns are said to have been wielded by 'gunslinger priests' during a now forgotten time` (<a href="https://wiki.spiralknights.com/Silversix" target="_blank">Silversix</a>). The theme of divinity here should be focused on, as it is similar to the heavenly theme of the heavenly kingdom, their focus on divine. Here it the aspect of Undead, as the gun has elemental damage.
- `Its bullets serve as ushers for those that refuse to leave this world` (<a href="https://wiki.spiralknights.com/Argent_Peacemaker" target="_blank">Argent Peacemaker</a>). It is an upgrade of <a href="https://wiki.spiralknights.com/Silversix" target="_blank">Silversix</a>, and serves the same purpose to combat undead, with a distinguishing description of them being: `those that refuse to leave this world`.

  Owlite <a href="https://wiki.spiralknights.com/Philoso_Feather" target="_blank">Philoso Feather</a> in its crafting is notable, either being created by Owlites, or is the assumption of alchemy transcending logic and being more of a thematic link between items in a similar manner as the <a href="https://wiki.spiralknights.com/Dragon_Scale_Shield#Alchemy_Path" target="_blank">dragon Scale Shield</a> alchemy path, discussed earlier.

  Those two handguns within single alchemy path establish a concept of gunslinger priests, which, at least, know of undead and potentially shadow damage, as it is dealt by the undead. And, as stated, those priests were gunslingers.

- `A shadow-aligned handgun of incredible power, its said to contain the soul of a knight who was only two days from retirement` (<a href="https://wiki.spiralknights.com/Blackhawk" target="_blank">Blackhawk</a>). This handgun in particular has 3 elements to it:

  - It was wielded by a knight, - this, within the context of the universe, suggest that it is an Isorian, a knight of Spiral Order or an earlier order.
  - the `shadow-aligned handgun of incredible power` wording, stated the nature of the handgun, as it deals shadow damages, but also suggests that shadow damages is that incredible power, considering this damage type being far more unnatural compared to the rest.
  - The bird imagery, likely a hawk, also links us back to the elemental line of Antigua above.

- `An ancient handgun forged from shadow steel. It is said to have been wielded by an evil one who possessed "angel eyes"` (<a href="https://wiki.spiralknights.com/Sentenza" target="_blank">Sentenza</a>). Shadow steel originates from the Underworld, and, as the handgun's design suggests, it was made near the same period of time as the all of the above with bird imagery. This duality can potentially link us to <a href="https://wiki.spiralknights.com/Armor_of_the_fallen" target="_blank">Armor of the Fallen</a>. But, before that, another element of gun specificity should be covered, that of Gunslinger alchemy path.
- <a href="https://wiki.spiralknights.com/Chilling_Duelist" target="_blank">Chilling Duelist</a> is of the same design as the rest of Antigua alchemy tree, with the addition of ice, which may be attributed to elemental materials the gun is alchemized from. It is acquired from the <a href="https://wiki.spiralknights.com/Deluxe_Starter_Pack" target="_blank">Deluxe Starter Pack</a>, which also contains <a href="https://wiki.spiralknights.com/Tri-Guard_Armor" target="_blank">Tri-Guard Set</a>: `A special suit of armor designed specifically for knights on first recon of alien planets. This rugged suit protects against a variety of harsh elements`. The armor seems more medieval compared to the rest, which might attribute it to an earlier period of time of Isorian history.

Gunslingers' sets have a similarity to the Antigua line, specifically the <a href="https://wiki.spiralknights.com/Gunslinger_Sash" target="_blank">gunslinger sash</a> has mention of `forgotten time`: `Clothing worn by pistol-packing warriors from a forgotten time` (<a href="https://wiki.spiralknights.com/Gunslinger_Sash" target="_blank">gunslinger sash</a>), as well as <a href="https://wiki.spiralknights.com/Silversix" target="_blank">Silversix</a>: `these handguns are said to have been wielded by 'gunslinger priests' during a now forgotten time`.

Considering the thematic element to both gunslinger set and Antigua, as they explicitly refer to a forgotten time, may be most solid argument to those being of the same period of time. But, this would also mean 2 things, or rather, scenarios:

- Isorians were already familiar with the Underworld, and forgot of it. They would also forget of elemental damage as it is one introduced currently by Owlites.
- As Avenger is alchemized from the Sealed Sword, which is exchanged from Slime Token, and so is <a href="https://wiki.spiralknights.com/Antigua" target="_blank">Antigua</a>, whose alchemy tree refers to a forgotten time and seem to belong it: `A mysterious relic from a forgotten time`. Could it be that the knights in question are of heavenly kingdom, and if so, are they Isorians?

Those cases is their possibility presents itself, must be analyzed.

##### Isorian Scenario 2

It is evident that at least gunslinger sash and Antigua are connected. Both have a reference to a forgotten time and both being low-tech equipment.

This makes it seem that forgotten time is referring to Isorians mainly due to occasional mention of knights and general thematic attribution of guns to Spiral Order rather than valkyries. Here then 2 different questions emerge:

- If spirits are known to return to material real, how undead managed to exist on Isora, unless it has similar metaphysic properties to Cradle?

  If it is on Cradle, as we discussed in a potential case of ancient Isorians forming kingdoms, then this would partially explain the inconsistency, as then the Core would be responsible for presence of spirits.

- Presence of Underworld and griffins. While dragons were established to be present on Isora, as per this theory, the prior 2 remain unsolved, especially the angelic motif in Sentenza's description: `It is said to have been wielded by an evil one who possessed "angel eyes"` (<a href="https://wiki.spiralknights.com/Sentenza" target="_blank">Sentenza</a>), although this could also be a reference to popular culture, specifically western cinematography. This pop-culture-based explanation, we believe, should be able to function within the in-universe narrative, one potentially relating to the heavenly kingdom.

The valkyries are brought up here due to the most interaction with Underworld. But, presented designs for the most part of the item roster do not fit to divine themes of valkyries, then it should be Isorians whose past was forgotten and who had to wield these equipment, as seen by mastery of guns amongst Spiral Order. Then, there must be a reason behind this time being labeled as forgotten. That can be likely attributed to a sheer timescale Isorians have existed as a spacefaring civilization, as evident by gear of <a href="https://wiki.spiralknights.com/Equinox_Prize_Box" target="_blank">Equinox Prize Box</a> described in the [spacefarers of old section](#spacefarers-of-old). But to recover them:

- `A special suit built to commemorate Isorian starfarers of old` (<a href="https://wiki.spiralknights.com/Celestial_Nav_Suit" target="_blank">Celestial Nav Suit</a>).
- `This suit was once worn by Isorian starfarers of eons long passed that stood watch over extrasolar operations` (<a href="https://wiki.spiralknights.com/Stellar_Sentinel_Suit" target="_blank">Stellar Sentinel Suit</a>).

As Isorians have existed for so long, they forgotten both elemental and shadow damage, and the less technologically advanced era. But there is also a different connotation - if gunslingers are Isorians, this would mean that they had interacted with Underworld, which would not be forgotten as long as specie exists, as seen by previous iteration of Underworld interacting with the material realm. Th shadow damage in that regard remains more vague compared to definitive state of elemental damage.

The lack of awareness of Underworld for modern-day Isorians makes it seem to us that thy did not encounter it. But, as we discussed earlier, Spiral Wardens design-wise are made to resemble trojans, and who came first had remained ambiguous. But, we believe, a this similarity is not a coincidence, as we covered Arkus, who had most explicitly closed the gap between the two. And, after his coverage, we were reminded of the potential explanation of trojans being the Spiral Wardens, corrupted by the curse in its non-lethal form, which would require Underworld and material realm at some point in time be connected.

Here, this connection is probable through the alchemy path of Gilded Griffin, as its wielders had potentially been in the Underworld, as implied by the myth of a griffin shining a light on the Underworld. Considering knights had remained as such, named as knights, the change in design of their military units under this narrative seems unlikely, leaving a room for Spiral Wardens, or simply wardens, to exist so far in the past. This also could be supported by the more medieval design of tier 1 trojans, where we discussed the usage of redwood in their chest-plate.

This proposal still would not explain the presence of spirits on Isora and a connection to the Underworld, even if it presents a weird west setting, which would seem fitting considering overall themes seen across Clockworks.

A variation of this proposal, one mentioned earlier, that explains gunslingers' nature, but also explains presence of undead and fiends is the pre-Cradle scenario, wherein gunslingers are from a planet, which was used to build Cradle. It attributes gunslingers to Isorians but allows for them to encounter Underworld is the case of those Isorians arriving at the same planet where Almire and Raiders would be present. As Almire was already connected to elemental damage, Spirit Mother, and eventually Vog, development of low-tech equipment utilizing those damage types would be more plausible. Presence of fiendish technology or magic, such as the [Blackened Shrine](#blackened-shrine-and-magma-deity), would only be fitting.

We return to the prior point of those stranded knights - potentially of Spiral Order, as to get to Cradle, one requires a vessel, - being at the origin of both legion of Ur, Almire, raiders, and now gunslingers. But, as far as this proposal based on assumptions, it seems one most fitting, considering other design choices regarding Almire and raiders.

This case would require elaboration on <a href="https://wiki.spiralknights.com/Sentenza" target="_blank">Sentenza</a>, as the presence of shadow steel would seal a connection of material realm and Underworld in relation to Isorians. Is so, <a href="https://wiki.spiralknights.com/Shadowsun_slicker" target="_blank">Shadowsun set</a>, specifically its usage of Shadow Steel is also diegetic, which would not seem such if not for Sentenza, attributing it to the Fallen Valkyrian of <a href="https://wiki.spiralknights.com/Armor_of_the_fallen" target="_blank">Armor of the Fallen</a>. <a href="https://wiki.spiralknights.com/Blackhawk" target="_blank">Blackhawk</a> in this context would suggest, that this shadow-alignment was more widespread than it seems (`A shadow-aligned handgun of incredible power, its said to contain the soul of a knight who was only two days from retirement` - <a href="https://wiki.spiralknights.com/Blackhawk" target="_blank">Blackhawk</a>).

Apart from Sentenza, there is also the <a href="https://wiki.spiralknights.com/Deadshot_Mantle" target="_blank">Deadshot Mantle</a> which has shadow defenses, but is not attributed to any evil or fiendish entity, having divine color scheme. Nad it also has curse resistance. its description - `A poncho for a pale rider with sights set on taking down the bad, ugly, undead denizens of the dark` - we believe, refers to the fiends, making it the only set, plausible for pairing with <a href="https://wiki.spiralknights.com/Gilded_Griffin" target="_blank">Gilded Griffin</a>. Apart from the color scheme, Deadshot mantle design is reminiscent of <a href="https://wiki.spiralknights.com/Divine_Mantle" target="_blank">Divine Mantle</a>, with both even labeled as mantles, not ponchos or cloaks, but specifically - one element of cloth, - the circular spiral imagery:

- <a href="https://wiki.spiralknights.com/File:Divine_Mantle-Equipped.png" target="_blank">Divine Mantle</a> has on its front has 2 spiral circles at the bottom of the garb's symbol.
- <a href="https://wiki.spiralknights.com/File:Deadshot_Mantle-Equipped.png" target="_blank">Deadshot Mantle</a> has the same as above spiral circles but at the bottom front of the mantle instead of the garb.

Under that framework elemental line of handguns remains unsolved.

##### Valkyrian Scenario

As many promotional items were seen on the context of Spiral Order and Isorians equipping them, being diegetic, same can be told of gunslinger items, while those are attributed to heavenly kingdom. This assumption mainly stems from the fact only valkyries are said to venture into Underworld and have a lasting effect on it, as described by <a href="https://wiki.spiralknights.com/Valkyrie_Mail" target="_blank">Valkyrian set</a>: `A priceless set of armor whose name denizens of the Underworld dare not mention`. At the same time, no piercing damage weaponry currently exists, which could be attributed to valkyries, that is assuming, they had both close and ranged combat techniques.

Within this context, we have to address the presence of griffin in guns' charge attacks. While only piercing lane has its mention, but has a dragon depicted, the rest have the same avian specie present as it is. This parallel of griffins and dragons, with the latter opposed to Underworld, seems to us as as a intentional design choice.

##### Identity of Valkyries

The <a href="https://wiki.spiralknights.com/Heavenly_Iron_Armor" target="_blank">Heavenly Iron set</a> links heavenly kingdom, valkyries and Owlites: `A powerful suit of armor said to be crafted from angelic shields. It retains many divine properties celestial beings possess but lacks their weakness to fire` (<a href="https://wiki.spiralknights.com/Heavenly_Iron_Armor" target="_blank">Heavenly Iron set</a>). Owlites and valkyries were both weak to fire and specialized in protecting themselves from it as well as shock, likely due to location of the kingdom in the clouds, the latter affirmed by the <a href="https://wiki.spiralknights.com/Storm_Chaser" target="_blank">storm chaser</a>: `A rare elemental found hovering in storm clouds. Their electric hum creates an almost melodic choir that can be faintly heard between thunderclaps`. Angelic shields in question seem to be absent.

There are several other valkyrian armors:

- <a href="https://wiki.spiralknights.com/Angelic_Raiment" target="_blank">Angelic Raiment</a>: `A beautiful suit of armor that constantly shines as if illuminated by the sun`. It is vulnerable to fire.
- `A priceless set of armor whose name denizens of the Underworld dare not mention` (<a href="https://wiki.spiralknights.com/Valkyrie_Mail" target="_blank">Valkyrie Mail</a>) is same as the above, resistant to curse, but vulnerable to fire.
- `It retains many divine properties celestial beings possess but lacks their weakness to fire` (<a href="https://wiki.spiralknights.com/Heavenly_Iron_Armor" target="_blank">Heavenly Iron Armor</a>) is strong to curse but vulnerable to shock, fire resistance is neutral in that case as specified by the armor itself, suggesting that it is an upgrade of the <a href="https://wiki.spiralknights.com/Valkyrie_Mail" target="_blank">Valkyrie Mail</a>.
- `A cursed suit of armor once worn by a celestial being cast down from paradise` (<a href="https://wiki.spiralknights.com/Armor_of_the_Fallen" target="_blank">Armor of the Fallen</a>) is different in that regard, while it has same high resistance to fire of Heavenly Iron set, but seems to be corrupted by Underworld, as it negates any dealt by wearer damage to fiends. It it but a result of a single entity's doing, likely a valkyrian, as suggested by the design borrowed from <a href="https://wiki.spiralknights.com/Valkyrie_Mail" target="_blank">Valkyrie Mail</a>.
- <a href="https://wiki.spiralknights.com/Radiant_Silvermail" target="_blank">Radiant Silvermail</a>: `An upgraded set of Silvermail that is said to shine brightly even in the darkest of hours.` It has <a href="https://wiki.spiralknights.com/Philoso_Feather" target="_blank">Philoso Feather</a> used in its alchemy. It as well as Silvermail reminiscent of Gilded Griffin with its description, as <a href="https://wiki.spiralknights.com/Silvermail" target="_blank">Silvermail</a> is described as: `Strong, yet light armor for knights who've sworn an oath to hunt down and destroy the undead, wherever it may lurk`.

  This thematic similarity, we believe, is present through shadow defenses, relation to darkness of, likely, Underworld, as shadow defense is present, and shining - same as griffin's, with attribution to piercing damage. And, as it is the end item of <a href="https://wiki.spiralknights.com/Drake_Scale_Mail" target="_blank">Drake Scale Mail</a> upgrade path, the piecing defense is likely derived from this beast scales - <a href="https://wiki.spiralknights.com/Drake_Scale" target="_blank">drake scales</a>, which are notable absent in Silvermail and its upgrade. Be propose, that it is the same motif of dragons opposing the Underworld.

  Herein Silvermail's description must be focused on: `Strong, yet light armor for knights who've sworn an oath to hunt down and destroy the undead, wherever it may lurk.` It is the mention of knights, same as <a href="https://wiki.spiralknights.com/Blackhawk" target="_blank">Blackhawk</a>: `its said to contain the soul of a knight who was only two days from retirement`.

- `A resplendent replica of the shield thought to have been issued to the most eminent of Owlite wizards. Wielding it fills you with righteous vengeance` (<a href="https://wiki.spiralknights.com/Grey_Owlite_Shield" target="_blank">Grey Owlite Shield</a>) is resistant to both fire and shock. It is one of 2 shield having same resists, the other being <a href="https://wiki.spiralknights.com/Crest_of_Almire" target="_blank">Crest of Almire</a>. The righteousness of Grey Owlite Shield is also similar to <a href="https://wiki.spiralknights.com/Seraphic_Mail" target="_blank">Seraphic Mail</a>: `A beautiful mail coat that causes its wearer to strike out at evil with righteous fury.`
- `A cloak for renowned Owlite scholars, this feathery frock is filled with the wisdom of the ages` (<a href="https://wiki.spiralknights.com/Grey_Feather_Mantle" target="_blank">Grey Feather Mantle</a>) is resistant to fire and shock, but significantly less, compared to the previous item.
- `A heavenly cloak thought to be once worn by celestial sages` (<a href="https://wiki.spiralknights.com/Divine_Mantle" target="_blank">Divine Mantle</a>) is mildly resistant to fire and shock, as well as curse. It is the only cloak in alchemy tree, that is resistant to shadow damage instead of elemental.

Alchemy for all of the above items involves an <a href="https://wiki.spiralknights.com/Owlite_Feather" target="_blank">Owlite feather</a>, marking another connection between Owlites and Valkyries. Based on those items we believe, that Owlite High Academy of Magicks had its own strategic role in the research field of defenses of valkyries. Some of the developed armors, while not directly offensive, were worn by the celestial sages of the Academy (`A heavenly cloak thought to be once worn by celestial sages` - <a href="https://wiki.spiralknights.com/Divine_Mantle" target="_blank">Divine Mantle</a>).

During Academy's continuous operation, Owlites had likely discovered an elemental realm, labeling it as the Nameless Realm (`A forbidden mantle said to grant the wearer protection within the nameless realm where all elements are said to converge into one and divide into all` - <a href="https://wiki.spiralknights.com/Chaos_Cloak" target="_blank">Chaos Cloak</a>) seemingly by the knowledge and Underworld materials acquired by Valkyrian incursion in to the Underworld at some point. But as of currently, Owlite academy was experimenting with many elements, which, compared to the valkyrian army, led to owlites' academy uniforms being protected from both fire and shock. Owlite more magic-directed armor and shields were designed to protect against specifically those elements, such alchemy tree of the <a href="https://wiki.spiralknights.com/Owlite_Shield" target="_blank">Owlite Shield</a>: `A sturdy shield similar to the sort said to have been carried by Owlite youth.`

Owlites also have researched ancient power of wind frenzy, finalized in the invention of the <a href="https://wiki.spiralknights.com/Turbillion" target="_blank">Turbillion</a>, as suggested by presence of the <a href="https://wiki.spiralknights.com/Owlite_Feather" target="_blank">Owlite Feathers</a> in its alchemy.

Alchemy tree of <a href="https://wiki.spiralknights.com/Owlite_Shield" target="_blank">Owlite Shield</a> as well as many other Owlite, Valkyrian and Kat Tribe items have fiendish <a href="https://wiki.spiralknights.com/Brimstone" target="_blank">brimstone</a>. As this is a material found in the Underworld-adjacent locations, it can also be attributed to a later period of time.

Alchemy has also been a common element, as its symbol, or rather symbol of alchemy orb, <a href="https://wiki.spiralknights.com/images/9/92/Divine_Tome_of_Rage-Equipped.png" target="_blank">is depicted</a> on the <a href="https://wiki.spiralknights.com/Tome_of_rage" target="_blank">tome of rage front cover</a>. This relates us back to the previous concept of alchemy and energy being universal, unless, Spiral Order managed to pass this knowledge, as they are known to master alchemy for a long time, discussed in [technology of Isorians](#technology-alchemy-and-isorian-redesigns): `Spiral Order has relied on alchemy as their primary means of creating the very arsenals that Knights have relied upon for centuries` (<a href="https://wiki.spiralknights.com/Alchemy_for_Beginners" target="_blank">Alchemy for Beginners</a>). We have to also consider that this tome is likely far older than most of Owlite civilization, as it was originally in the <a href="https://wiki.spiralknights.com/Rage_Prize_Box" target="_blank">Rage Prize Box</a>, which had relation more so to Valkyries, than Owlites. This is also an argument is favour of valkyries being distinct from Owlites, which still had to be considered.

Owlites and Valkyries are referred to as celestial and angelic beings, moreover, <a href="https://wiki.spiralknights.com/Seraphynx" target="_blank">Seraphynx</a>, despite being a Kat-like battle sprite, has theme of divinity and skill labeled Angelic Aura, which can be turned into Seraphic Aura and Valkyrian Aura.

All of those parallels in design and internal logic, we believe, point to the idea of Owlites and valkyries being the same, or related, avian species. If related, valkyries could be griffons, as the one implied in the description of <a href="https://wiki.spiralknights.com/Gilded_Griffin" target="_blank">Gilded Griffin</a>: `A beautiful pistol named after a great, noble beast. Its golden frame was believed to provide light within the impenetrable darkness of the Underworld`, while disregarding it being a dragon.

A subtle element of this ambiguity is also found in the description of [Raiment](<https://wiki.spiralknights.com/Raiment_(Costume)>): `A long, flowing battle garb best accessorized with a pair of angelic wings`.

##### Analysis of Forgotten Time

All of those factor seem to us as Valkyries being related to Owlites at least by their habitat, but through symbolism and design, resemble Spiral Order.

Within this framework where gunslinger priests would fit? It was established that Spiral Order had either forgotten this period of time with the knowledge of those elements and Underworld, only remote Isorians discovered it, fitting in the low-tech setting, or belonging to heavenly kingdom, due to both having experience of Underworld.

Here we can attempt to look into the designs of handguns as well as their traders in the Hall of Heroes in Haven Garrison.

Among all traders present, only <a href="https://wiki.spiralknights.com/Archilus" target="_blank">Archilus</a> notes on origin of Elemental damage, but not <a href="https://wiki.spiralknights.com/Walkon" target="_blank">Walkon</a> in relation to slimes and lichens not <a href="https://wiki.spiralknights.com/Sylvin" target="_blank">Sylvin</a> on shadow damage, but acknowledging existence of undead and fiends.

As there is seeming lack of any other leads as well as a loose definition of a knight, we propose a potential solution, but one, we believe, had to be iterated on, as currently it is essentially used to write off majority of the inconsistencies and anachronisms.

The forgotten time in question is the early period of time from Isorians on planet, which would be incorporated into Cradle, pr one becoming it, - it is the time when Raiders, kingdoms of Ironmight and Almire have stemmed. None of those parties were familiar with the undeath, as well as they did not know of elemental defenses nor damage, but they knew of normal and piercing, so far it is consistent:

- For kingdom of Ironmight: <a href="https://wiki.spiralknights.com/Ironmight_Plate_Mail" target="_blank">Ironmight set</a>
- For kingdom of Almire: <a href="https://wiki.spiralknights.com/Almirian_Crusader_Armor" target="_blank">Almirian Crusader Armor</a>, <a href="https://wiki.spiralknights.com/Volcanic_Plate_Mail" target="_blank">Volcanic Plate set</a>.
- For gunslingers: <a href="https://wiki.spiralknights.com/Antigua" target="_blank">Antigua</a>, <a href="https://wiki.spiralknights.com/Gilded_Griffin" target="_blank">Gilded Griffin</a>, <a href="https://wiki.spiralknights.com/Justifier_Jacket" target="_blank">Justifier Jacket</a>, <a href="https://wiki.spiralknights.com/Nameless_Poncho" target="_blank">Nameless Poncho</a>
- For raiders: <a href="https://wiki.spiralknights.com/Squall_Caller" target="_blank">Squall Caller</a>, <a href="https://wiki.spiralknights.com/Winter%27s_Edge" target="_blank">Winter's Edge</a>

Undeath would not be encountered up until first interactions with the Underworld, or, more likely, by effects of the Underworld's curse in a manner, in which Lord Vanaduke's fires had transformed legions of Almire. By that we mean initial creation of Legion of Ur, the trojans, as transformed Spiral Wardens.

This precedent would explain singular existence and nature of Maulos, as well as the trojans' origins being Spiral Wardens. Gunslingers, but only partially, likely with the draconic designs - which had originated on Isora, - were the ones to introduce guns to valkyries, who - Owlites, - would adopt and adapt it, and redesign with avian motif and elemental damage, which came into the modern times as an imagery of a griffin.

This interpretation seems far more complex that it had to be, but, with this, we tie a necessity of Underworld and griffins to provide light in it, as <a href="https://wiki.spiralknights.com/Gilded_Griffin" target="_blank">Gilded Griffin</a> states: `A beautiful pistol named after a great, noble beast. Its golden frame was believed to provide light within the impenetrable darkness of the Underworld`.

Isorians of this forgotten time, based on the Shadowsun set recipes, were ones to rediscover Underworld, although unrelated to tortomega plot line. It was not yet the time valkyries carried out their own incursion, but rather its Isorian wardens which were the victims of this connection to the Underworld, leading to creation of Legion of Ur. And only later Valkyries would carry out their own expedition into the Underworld, one characterized, or likely, initialized by the actions of a figure of fallen valkyrian, now only known as the Fallen.

It is during this period of time <a href="https://wiki.spiralknights.com/Cold_Iron_Carver" target="_blank">Cold Iron Carver</a> and <a href="https://wiki.spiralknights.com/Cold_Iron_Vanquisher" target="_blank">Cold Iron Vanquisher</a> would be invented, as they all have now familiar imagery of the curse. Vanquisher in that regard is one with a particular imagery of a horned skull with a single eye, reminiscent of titans in their most powerful period of time, considering that is is a helm which was interpreted as a skull as we have seen in the Titan Gates. Vanquisher's alchemy path has normal damage, but is designed to smite Undead, which would also fit under the logic of early period of time, wherein Isorians, likely of Ironmight, were experimenting with the elemental damage.

We also suggest, that it is during this period of time more modern iterations of Tortomega's Troika would be invented - <a href="https://wiki.spiralknights.com/Triglav" target="_blank">Triglav</a> as one containing Underworld's everfrost, and <a href="https://wiki.spiralknights.com/Sudaruska" target="_blank">Sudaruska</a>. Both are normal damage weapons but possess a subtle aspect of magic, similar to the aforementioned <a href="https://wiki.spiralknights.com/Cold_Iron_Vanquisher" target="_blank">Cold Iron Vanquisher</a>.

Those weapons only could've been invented with the knowledge of Underworld. At that, as <a href="https://wiki.spiralknights.com/Troika" target="_blank">Troika</a> alchemy tree is presented here, we suggest this period existing on the same planet as tortodrones' or titans' civilization. The thing that is left ambiguous then - why heavenly kingdom became involved so late into the events of Lord Vanaduke's return? Possible explanation for it could be the idea of heavenly kingdom being either not concerned with those events unless a direct threat would be presented.

Here we should also touch upon the small theme of gold and divinity connection:

- <a href="https://wiki.spiralknights.com/Gilded_Griffin" target="_blank">Gilded Griffin</a>: `Its golden frame was believed to provide light within the impenetrable darkness of the Underworld`.
- <a href="https://wiki.spiralknights.com/Harness" target="_blank">Golden battle sprite harness</a> deals piercing damage, but can't be equipped on Drakon, with the same damage type inconsistency of piercing damage of Morai armor and <a href="https://wiki.spiralknights.com/Riftlocker" target="_blank">Riftlocker</a> used by the Spiral Order.

We believe, this motif is related to alchemy, as gold was considered pure, divine metal, representing physical and spiritual perfection, and one, which, but on a different matter would serve on par with silver in opposition to Shadow Steel of Underworld.

And, as for the handguns of ths period of time, <a href="https://wiki.spiralknights.com/Argent_Peacemaker" target="_blank">Argent Peacemaker</a> would be invented with the rest of elemental developments from Isorian gunslingers to heavenly kingdom. Owlite Academy Of Macgics were at the frontier of elemental research, which would become prominent as we will dover the Fallen Valkyrian. All of those similarities make it seem for us as if all those cultures were deeply intertwined at some point in time, in the similar manner to the existence of <a href="https://wiki.spiralknights.com/Statue#Heavy_Statue" target="_blank">heavy statues</a>. This would resolve both in-game status resistances, as an argument for physiological similarities, as well as symbolic and thematic parallels. One last argument in favour of valkyries being Owlites is the fact all of known civilization, including yet to be discussed Kat Tribe and gremlins, consist of a single specie, so for heavenly kingdom, ot at least, its army, being of Isorians, while the rest were Owlites seems as far less plausible.

##### Celestial Kingdom

One last suggestion, which could back this convoluted chain of event, a potential explanation for the identity of heavenly kingdom, is the inspiration by the Celestial Kingdom of Chinese Mythology.

Celestial kingdom is ruled by the Jade Emperor. Queen Mother of the West is the guardian of souls, of the spiritual realm, and represents the balance of nature. This description is most reminiscent of the Spirit Mother. Within the Celestial Kingdom reside spirits, which is similar to our understanding of the Nameless Realm, albeit with western alchemical ideas.

Finally, there are the Four Heavenly Kings. Despite the title, they are guardians of Heavens, protecting the Celestial Kingdom from even entering. <a href="https://wiki.spiralknights.com/Oni_Helm" target="_blank">Oni Helm</a> has similar description of a fiend: `Designed to frighten their enemies, this helm is in the visage of a fiend who lives in the mountains of a distant land. Said to guard the gate to heaven itself, it only allows those who are worthy to pass`.

Those similarities seem intentional, distinguished from the general themes and motifs across many different mythos, apart from Christianity, which, as will will further discuss, has its prevalence. This, we believe, still marks a distinction between physiology of celestial beings in the context of Spiral Knights, and ones within the material realm, extrapolated onto many different species.

Considering an interpretation could be suggested, that Owlites followed later with the Kat Tribe, into the empty heavenly kingdom and Scarlet Fortress. But, within this theory, we appeal to the status resistances argument, which identifies valkyries as Owlites, unless more evident discoveries would be presented.

##### Knights of the Rose

One of the last remaining elements of this forgotten time, we propose, are the Knights of the Rose. Their the Nature motif is present is one other instance from a similar period of time of medieval Europe.

Knight of the Rose are described in the <a href="https://wiki.spiralknights.com/Tabard_of_the_Prismatic_Rose#Tabard_of_the_Prismatic_Rose" target="_blank">Tabard of the Rose</a>: `An aged, embroidered tabard that once belonged to a Knight of the Rose, a sacred order of brave and especially dashing heroes whose numerous adventures are the subject of many folk tales. The Knights of the Rose were said to be peerless fencers, believing that their blades were like the flowers of their name: a delicate thing of beauty that hides a vicious sting`.

As they are described as fencers, the only equipment that could potentially fit to them is the <a href="https://wiki.spiralknights.com/Flourish" target="_blank">Flourish</a> alchemy tree.

The <a href="https://wiki.spiralknights.com/Fowl_Cloak" target="_blank">Fowl Cloak</a> of <a href="https://wiki.spiralknights.com/Rooster_Prize_Box" target="_blank">Rooster Prize Box</a> is the bringing element to tabards and Strangers as it has the same pattern weaved on cloth as a few Haven canopies (<a href="https://wiki.spiralknights.com/File:Brown_Fowl-Set.png" target="_blank">Fowl Set pattern</a>). Similar to the cloak, <a href="https://wiki.spiralknights.com/Tabard" target="_blank">tabards of the rose</a> of <a href="https://wiki.spiralknights.com/Rose_Regalia_Prize_Box" target="_blank">Rose Regalia Prize Box</a> and a <a href="https://forums.spiralknights.com/en/node/95665" target="_blank">letter</a>. It is important to note meaning of tabard - a type of coat being worn in late middle ages Europe, used both in and out of military context.

Fencers' armor designs are similar to Fowl's which are the same as the patterns on canopies across [Haven](#strangers-and-haven). This fact, as well as nature motif of knights of the Rose, we believe makes it seem that knight of the rose were Almirians. The question is, how Vaelyn, for example, had in her possession her Grand Flourish and Final Flourish? We propose an explanation - as with gunslingers and regular close-combat knights, their weapons, their designs, fencers were also present on Isora with the rest of first generation of Isorians, but only there they got the distinctive nature motif, reminiscent of kingdom of Almire.

The fact that Stranger have those designs prior to arrival of Spiral Order during game's evCould strangers be influenced by designs of Isorians? Yes, is those introduced it events seems to us as a solid proof of those designs being as such. Otherwise there would be no reason for Spiral Order to take Strangers' designs as the basis for tabards', including their framing as something coming, yet again, from the past.

##### Fallen Valkyrian

As it was mentioned, we believe Fallen Valkyrian is the reason why heavenly kingdom invaded Underworld.

We would not attempt to understand Fallen's motivation or reasoning, as there is practically no information on him. But one thing, we believe is certain - what was done ny him, had its effect so large, that he had to be banished into the Underworld. We suggest, heavenly kingdom hadn't stopped at this, ending in the know by the Valkyrian set incursion into the Underworld.

But, based on the designs of the armor, and its recipes, we can attempt to piece together what happened back then:

- <a href="https://wiki.spiralknights.com/Armor_of_the_fallen" target="_blank">Armor of the Fallen</a>: `A cursed suit of armor once worn by a celestial being cast down from paradise`.
- <a href="https://wiki.spiralknights.com/Crown_of_the_Fallen" target="_blank">Crown of the Fallen</a>: `A cursed crown once worn by a celestial being cast down from paradise`

The "celestial" characteristic is one used to refer to valkyries in the <a href="https://wiki.spiralknights.com/Heavenly_Iron_Helm" target="_blank">Heavenly Iron Helm</a> description: `A powerful helm said to be crafted from angelic shields. It retains many divine properties celestial beings possess but lacks their weakness to fire`.

The paradise in that regard, as it takes more religious connotation, is the heavenly kingdom, the Scarlet Fortress being what remains of it. And it seems to us fitting from current themes, that this narrative parallels to a religious one, - what is heavenly kingdom of valkyries if not the externalized kingdom of God?

In that context, <a href="https://wiki.spiralknights.com/Sentenza" target="_blank">Sentenza</a>, as it is forged from Shadow Steel, could potentially belong to the Fallen instead of the Shadowsun set mainly due to how it has all of avian imagery, which was not explained in the detail earlier, concluding on cultural differences between Isorians and Valkyries as one had to adapt foreign designs.

A proposal that would not conflict with the earlier conclusions, while explaining the difference in designs, could be that all guns were originally invented by Isorians, from the Antigua. As modern day Spiral Order has still occasional imagery of dragons, Gilded Griffin we would attribute to pre-cradle Isorians, while the rest could be adapted versions, modified by back then present heavenly kingdom, due to how avian designs are not present in modern Spiral Order.

As the Fallen was banished into the Underworld, Valkyries had head an incursion into Underworld, and then sealed both the Fallen and the Legion of Ur (`Strangely, the memo indicated that the Legion of Ur was sealed away in the Underworld and that an alternative approach would be required for bringing them back` - <a href="https://wiki.spiralknights.com/The_Return_of_Ur" target="_blank">The Return of Ur</a>). <a href="https://wiki.spiralknights.com/Crests_of_Ur" target="_blank">Crest of Ur</a> contains an addition to this hypothesized timeline of events: `A crest from the lost Legion of Ur, an elite band of fiendish warrior said to have once conquered the Underworld. Whomever holds it can faintly hear the sound of drums and the clomping of hooves`.

This Crest has 2 notable properties: the supernatural presence of trojans and the fact legion of Ur had conquered the Underworld. The supernatural presence of trojans is similar to Snarbolax's equipment curse properties:

- <a href="https://wiki.spiralknights.com/Barbarous_Thorn_Blade" target="_blank">Barbarous Thorn Blade</a> is described as causing visual hallucinations: `Those who wield it claim to feel the fiery stare of the beast upon them whenever they close their eyes`.
- <a href="https://wiki.spiralknights.com/Barbarous_Thorn_Shield" target="_blank">Barbarous Thorn Shield</a> has similar properties: `its said the beast can use the glowing orbs on the shield's face to see and stalk weak-hearted wielders`

And, as discussed in [Snarbolax and empowerment through curse section](#snarbolax-and-empowerment-through-curse), all those instances of haunting in varying severity are explained by the unnatural, from the position of material realm, properties.

It is said that the legion had conquered the Underworld, and based on the above information, was sealed there. We also concluded that it is the same army Lord Vanaduke had led when he returned from the erupting volcanic mountains. The fact of trojans being conquerors would mean that they either were a small power earlier, or were introduced to the Underworld to seize the power over it.

Our theory suggests that trojans are wardens, so their arrival is fitting here, but this would also mean that one had to lead them - a lack of Legion's commander. At that point we would suggest that this figurehead would be the Fallen, as this type of power shift, rippling through time, would be a reason for a banishment for the Fallen under the near-biblical framing of the event, as it is presented in set's description. this inevitably would lead to establishment of the Fallen as Ur, whose identity of a commander of Underworld high-class figure would match, and, we suggest that it is such, as the armor suggests, the valkyrian in questing did have a physiological transformation, implied by armor's stats change, but also more magic-like changes, notably - <a href="https://wiki.spiralknights.com/Crown_of_the_Fallen" target="_blank">Crown of the Fallen</a> has shadow halo, similar to one in <a href="https://wiki.spiralknights.com/Valkyrie_Helm" target="_blank">Valkyrie Helm</a>. And, as Valkyrian armors have <a href="https://wiki.spiralknights.com/Trojan_Horseshoe" target="_blank">Trojan Horseshoe</a> as a fiendish material, this, apart from a need to design a recipe, points to high importance of this event.

One last element for this idea is the ownership of <a href="https://wiki.spiralknights.com/Champion_Helm" target="_blank">Champion Helms</a> of rage, frenzy and storms. As we discussed, tortomega are unlikely candidates, but at that time no other civilization could claim ownership of the gear, apart from valkyries themselves. And at that time they did not have any known internal conflicts. But now, as there is an event which caused a valkyrian to be banished in a near-biblical manner, we can suggest that this valkyrian had its own followers, armed with such equipment. And, coincidentally, teh wording - `The helm of one who defied the gods and razed the gates of a heavenly kingdom` is reminiscent of the Fallen Valkyrian.

This is only a possibility, but one we believe should be considered and discussed, as the designs of those items are, under current theory, similar to tortomega ancient designs, but also to <a href="https://wiki.spiralknights.com/Volcanic_Plate_Helm" target="_blank">Volcanic Plate set</a> of more modern times of raiders, Ironmight, and Almire.

<h3 align="center">Chapter <code>VIII</code>: Kat Tribe</h3>

The events of Kataclysm take place around 1000 years after the fall of Almire. At that point only heavenly kingdom remains with inhabiting it valkyries and Owlites, while tortomega titans are long gone, and Almire itself had turned into ashen land with the included former kingdoms around it. The raiders are absent, in relation to [Operation Gelid](#operation-gelid-and-other-methods-of-escaping-cradle), it could be plausible for them to survive in the northern regions of Cradle. Notes on Almire were described in many tomes within the established Owlite Academy of Magicks. The <a href="https://wiki.spiralknights.com/Owlite_tome_text_Dialogue/The_Forgotten_Library" target="_blank">Forgotten Library</a>, wherein first written texts about kingdom of Almire were found, is located in the halls of the High Academy of magicks, now known as the Candlestick Keep.

After the events of valkyries invading the Underworld, many fiend-related discoveries were made, we can identify those by their recipes, which contain either undead or fiendish materials. Gunslinger priests were Owlites who used ranged combat during the period when the Fallen was cast down from Heavenly Kingdom, and leading to formation of Legion of Ur.

Far later, Philoso, an Owlite magician and wizard was born (`A large, grey feather plucked from the greatest of the Owlite magicians` <a href="https://wiki.spiralknights.com/Philoso_Feather" target="_blank">Philoso Feather</a>). He is responsible for many developments of Owlites around combat and handguns within the Owlite Academy. Evident by gear made with his feathers, he was specializing in elemental combat against the Undead. Considering that undead-oriented defensed and weaponry, it could be Almirian Empire, as at that point it is undead being the invader. Apart from them, undead could be a part of Underworld army during the event of Valkyries invading it.

To reiterate on the equipment, discussed in the previous sections regarding Owlite and Valkyrian technological advancements.

- Divine Mantle being the result of incorporation knowledge of curse into divine aspect of valkyrian elemental technique.
- Divine Avenger being a case of inverting the curse from the Underworld, or rather, negating it.
- <a href="https://wiki.spiralknights.com/Argent_Peacemaker" target="_blank">Argent Peacemaker</a> being developed from Isorian gunslingers to combat undead by Owlites.
- <a href="https://wiki.spiralknights.com/Radiant_Silvermail" target="_blank">Radiant Silvermail</a>, <a href="https://wiki.spiralknights.com/Silvermail" target="_blank">Silvermail</a> and <a href="https://wiki.spiralknights.com/Valkyrie_Mail" target="_blank">Valkyrie Mail</a> were devised to assist valkyries in the Underworld.
- <a href="https://wiki.spiralknights.com/Omegaward" target="_blank">Omegaward</a> as no other civilization would not be as skilled in elemental damage mastery, could be attributed to Owlites. Other case could be Spiral Order, as they did research Owlite technology.
- <a href="https://wiki.spiralknights.com/Deadly_Crystal_Bomb" target="_blank">Deadly Crystal Bomb</a> with application of Valestone mixed with Moonstone.
- <a href="https://wiki.spiralknights.com/Owlite_Shield" target="_blank">Owlite shield</a>
- <a href="https://wiki.spiralknights.com/Grey_Feather_Mantle" target="_blank">Grey Feather set</a>

After the Fallen was banished, after Almire had fallen, and after Legion of Ur was sealed, within this relatively stable period of time, Kat tribe emerges. But, to touch upon Philoso one last time. We propose, that exactly his discoveries after Legion of Ur was sealed, led to the discovery of the Nameless realm, based on the presence of Crest of Ur in alchemy of the Chaos Cloak, with the present imagery of the antique evil eye, seen in heavy statue. The very fact that is is stated to be forbidden, seems to us as the invention too dangerous even for the heavenly kingdom. As we touched on the curse here, <a href="https://wiki.spiralknights.com/Avenger" target="_blank">Avenger</a> we believe also belong to the time the Valkyries invaded underworld and sealed the Legion of Ur: `A holy sword created in another time to arm knights who fought against the legions of the Underworld`.

This leads to a specific point in time, which marks introduction of the evil eye, in the form of the dread seal, to heavenly kingdom in such a manner that would allow for its practical usage. Considering this, we propose that the sealed sword was the point when those researchers began, as it is less advanced, and has the same paper dread seal, similar to Lumber's dread seal, which, as we discussed, was constructed by gremlins, who also work with shadow damage, but to a far lesser extent. The nature of sealed sword, its upgrades is one of more notable element to the nature of curse overall as well as more direct depictions of capacity and limits to transform and reapply it in same manner - like the Divine Avenger alchemy path.

Application and origin of the <a href="https://wiki.spiralknights.com/Dread_Seal" target="_blank">Dread Seal</a> will be covered in consideration of Carnavons, which will be analyzed later in the context of Shadow Lairs.

#### Siege of the Academy

At some point, Owlites encountered the Kat Tribe. The reason of this conflict can be established mainly through the remains of Kat Tribe in the form of summoned Black Kats. Owlites are at war with the Kat Tribe.

Owlites are related to vengeance, which, considering their relation to valkyries, is fitting (<a href="https://wiki.spiralknights.com/Grey_Owlite_Shield" target="_blank">Grey Owlite Shield</a>)

Kat tribe, or at least, invasion of the Academy was led by Margrel: `A reclaimed raiment that is brimming with dark energy. It is said to resemble the great Kat Tribe hero, Margrel, the one who opened The Book of Grey Feathers and brought about the Kataclysm. It brings great misfortune to anyone who dares to wear it` (<a href="https://wiki.spiralknights.com/Black_Kat_Raiment" target="_blank">Black Kat Raiment</a>). Yet, it is known that now all kats are literate: `It appears that illiteracy is still rampant among the black kat hordes, so they have once more taken to eating the pilfered pages rather than using them for arcane rituals` ([Kataclysmic Confrontation!](https://forums.spiralknights.com/en/node/100025)).

There are a few subordinates we know of:

- Nappers (`An impressive mail instilled with the might of Kat Nappers, the undercover sleeper cell of the Kat Tribe` - <a href="https://wiki.spiralknights.com/Black_Kat_Mail" target="_blank">Black Kat Mail</a>).
- Torair (`A reclaimed raiment said to resemble the Kat Tribe hero, Torair, who clung to the gates of the Owlite High Academy of Magicks as both it and his explosives burned` - <a href="https://wiki.spiralknights.com/Kat_Hiss_Raiment" target="_blank">Kat Hiss Raiment</a>).
- Preowa (`A reclaimed raiment said to resemble the Kat Tribe hero, Preowa, whose artillery silenced the Grey Feather Tower Sages` - <a href="https://wiki.spiralknights.com/Kat_Eye_Raiment" target="_blank">Kat Eye Raiment</a>).
- Scraith (`A reclaimed raiment said to resemble the Kat Tribe hero, Scraith, first to scale the walls of the Owlite High Academy of Magicks` - <a href="https://wiki.spiralknights.com/Kat_Claw_Raiment" target="_blank">Kat Claw Raiment</a>).

Based on <a href="https://wiki.spiralknights.com/Black_Kat_Raiment" target="_blank">Black Kat Raiment's design</a> as a cursed armor, <a href="https://wiki.spiralknights.com/Margrel" target="_blank">Margrel's design</a>, <a href="https://wiki.spiralknights.com/Grimalkin#Black_Kat" target="_blank">Black Kats' design</a>, as well as <a href="https://wiki.spiralknights.com/Seraphynx" target="_blank">Seraphynx</a> battle sprite, we can guess approximate presentation of Kats:

- Coat pattern of <a href="https://wiki.spiralknights.com/Kat_Hiss_Cowl" target="_blank">Kat Hiss Cowl</a> looks same as the siamese variant of [Seraphynx](<https://wiki.spiralknights.com/Seraphynx_(Siamese)>).
- Inverted color scheme of <a href="https://wiki.spiralknights.com/Kat_Eye_Cowl" target="_blank">Kat Eye Cowl</a> resembles the tabby [Seraphynx](<https://wiki.spiralknights.com/Seraphynx_(Tabby)>).
- <a href="https://wiki.spiralknights.com/Kat_Claw_Cowl" target="_blank">Kat Claw Cowl</a> does not have a relevant fur coat pattern for Seraphynx.

#### Nature of Owlite Tomes

With that equipment Kat Tribe had invaded Owlite High Academy of Magicks. Discussing the Academy one particular naming convention of Grey Feathers is present there in 2 instances:

- `A reclaimed raiment said to resemble the Kat Tribe hero, Preowa, whose artillery silenced the Grey Feather Tower Sages` (<a href="https://wiki.spiralknights.com/Kat_Eye_Raiment" target="_blank">Kat Eye Raiment</a>). A tower within the Academy is established here.
- `A cloak for renowned Owlite scholars, this feathery frock is filled with the wisdom of the ages` (<a href="https://wiki.spiralknights.com/Grey_Feather_Mantle" target="_blank">Grey Feather Mantle</a>) belonging to renowned Owlite scholars, likely those in the Grey Feather Tower.

We can attempt to map Grey Feather Tower, considering the medieval castle-like theme of heavenly kingdom, onto the general castle plan with considerations of the tower's purpose. Under this logic we can suggest 2 places for the tower: as one of the dungeon or the keep itself. The keep is the most protected, inner structure of the castle, wherein castle's ruler chambers, living quarters, and treasury are located, while the dungeon is predominantly used as the quarters and armory for the castles army. But, as the aesthetics of the narrative and depth-dependant design are paramount here, same as the design of Firestorm Citadel - that of the general idea of the Owlite Academy being a castle-like structure, we would not focus of this detail, but rather relations between known items, equipment and descriptions.

Although coincidentally, the location of the academy is referred to as the Candlestick Keep, which may potentially refer to the keep of the academy being the location Knights were traversing, rather that its Grey Feather tower, but it is more likely that the academy, being more fantasy-themed, has multiple tower in its structure.

Also, considering the followup events, and the motif of the same item capable of exiting in its multiple iteration through alchemy under different names, we can hypothesize, that the Book of Dark Rituals is the very Book of Grey Feathers, considering the scope of the effects it causes when ill-used in the Moorcroft Manor.

Despite this vagueness, we can suggest, that the location of the Book of Grey Feathers was in this tower. It is then the Book itself whose nature and abilities remains unknown:

- `[Black kats] carry the heaviest curse of all and mindlessly seek to devour magical auras. This constant consuming of power makes them incredibly strong. They were likely attracted to the power radiating from the ancient grimoires here in the Archives` (<a href="https://wiki.spiralknights.com/Pembrooke#Dialogue" target="_blank">Pembrooke</a>)
- `These shadowy beasts hunger for arcane power and raided the Moorcroft Manor Archives' precious collection of magical grimoires. In the wrong hands these ancient tomes could be catastrophic, but it turns out that Black Kats can't read, so they instead decided to just eat them. The residents of Moorcroft Manor would like you to retrieve the Ancient Pages of the magical grimoires that quite likely reside in the stomachs of Black Kats. We'll leave you to figure out just how to recover them` ([Kataclysmic Confrontation! - Path Notes: 2013.01.30](https://forums.spiralknights.com/en/node/73222))

##### Magical Auras

Based on those descriptions of Owlite tomes we can make an educated guess that the auras are bound, at least, to those Owlite tomes, - that the books themselves contain this raw power which can cause the Kataclysm: `In the wrong hands these ancient tomes could be catastrophic, but it turns out that Black Kats can't read` ([Kataclysmic Confrontation! - Path Notes: 2013.01.30](https://forums.spiralknights.com/en/node/73222)). And, as the pages are the ones returned to Montague, it is likely the pages themselves contain the auras, but it is unknown weather the fact Owlite text is written on those pages, is what grants them an aura, attracting Black Kats, or it is the property of the books themselves. We believe it is important in order to better understand the concept of auras, which we had discussed previously in the [Auras and Souls section](#auras-and-souls).

Then there are Moorcroft Archives, to which, we believe <a href="https://wiki.spiralknights.com/Moorcroft_Furniture#Stands" target="_blank">Tomes in the stands</a> belong. In that regard, we can look closed at the cursed and mystical tome stands, as they give out more information in regards to the nature of Owlite texts, and by proxy, auras.

Here we should make a note, that the <a href="https://wiki.spiralknights.com/Ancient_Tome_Stand#Ancient_Tome_Stand" target="_blank">ancient tome stand</a> may potentially belong to the kingdom of Almire, as it is the same model which is used in the final chamber of the <a href="https://wiki.spiralknights.com/Inner_Sanctum" target="_blank">Inner Sanctum</a>. Considering the interest of Owlites with the kingdom of Almire, we believe it is be very plausible to move the recovered texts to the Archive after the event of the <a href="https://wiki.spiralknights.com/Legion_of_Almire" target="_blank">Legion of Almire</a>.

##### Causes of Kataclysm

Based on the <a href="https://wiki.spiralknights.com/File:Furniture-Cursed_Tome_Stand-Animated.png" target="_blank">behavior</a> of <a href="https://wiki.spiralknights.com/Cursed_Tome_Stand#Cursed_Tome_Stand" target="_blank">cursed tome stand</a>, as it creates a cursed field around itself and summons an idle spookat, we can parallel it to the later summoning of Margrel through the Book of Dark Rituals, creating a maelstrom of curse with the Black Kat himself:

- It is known that some time after Margrel had recovered the The Book of Grey Feathers, the Kataclysm has happened. It is plausible that the Kataclysm, as we have suggested, had originated from the Academy by the action of Margrel reading through the Owlite texts, mainly due to how the Academy is covered by darkness similar to the Graveyards and so different from the Scarlet Fortress.
- The fact that the cursed maelstrom appears due to, seemingly, improper application of the Book of Dark Rituals - as suggested by <a href="https://wiki.spiralknights.com/Konjuring_Kat#Dialogue" target="_blank">Konjuring Kat</a> before and after fight with Margrel: `I have no idea what might happen. It could be very bad. You probably want to be prepared in case things go... awry. ... Well, that was unexpected. I'll get it right next time!` we can make a guess that the knight's interaction with the cursed tome stand is also improper, or the very state of those tomes being cursed causes this pattern.
- To add to the point above, the fact that mystical tome stand seems to be free of curse, the interaction here is not accompanied by curse, suggesting that it is the property of cursed tomes which summons members of kat tribe in their undeath to the material realm. It is then to question, weather the Book of Grey Feather was already cursed, or it is the unpredictability of the magic within.

Based on the other Owlite discovery - the Chaos Cloak: `A forbidden mantle said to grant the wearer protection within the nameless realm where all elements are said to converge into one and divide into all` (<a href="https://wiki.spiralknights.com/Chaos_Cloak" target="_blank">Chaos Cloak</a>), being named as such, as well as being forbidden, we can guess that it is the latter case of unpredictability of magic.

In that context we have yet to understand, how imagery of the curse eys on Kat Tribe armors related to the metaphysics of those cursed tomes.

Here we have to argue, weather presence of multiple Books of Dark Ritual is canon to the timeline, as, to parallel Lord Vanaduke through his drop of Seals of Almire, in both cases their respective material or tokens is not enough from a single defeat to transmute any of thematic equipment. We propose, that this is not diegetic to the game, as the rank mission of <a href="https://wiki.spiralknights.com/Shadowplay" target="_blank">Shadowplay</a> explicitly tells of what has happened after Lord's banishment: `We all sensed the moment you defeated Vanaduke. The entire citadel shook as he fell and for a moment we thought that this realm would be destroyed along with its ruler. You must be careful wandering these halls with the place coming apart like this!` (<a href="https://wiki.spiralknights.com/Shadowplay/Overgrown_Court" target="_blank">Nature Sprite</a>). It is important to the understanding of where precisely is the original book of Grey Feather is located, as then the Book of Dark Rituals could in fact be the very Book of Grey Feathers which had Margrel read through, supposedly, at the top of the Grey Feathers tower, and we believe it would be conclusive for the book to be the tool to bring Margrel back through the Dark Ritual many years later. To seemingly affirm this idea of Book of Dark Ritual being the Book of Grey Feather, suggests the fact that it is known as the book containing dark rituals, similar to the <a href="https://wiki.spiralknights.com/Cursed_Tome_Stand#Cursed_Tome_Stand" target="_blank">cursed tome stand</a>, which was at some point an Owlite tome, yet is described as follows: `A podium displaying an ominous tome filled with unreadable scribbles and smudged ink prints of Kat paws`. It was in possession of Kats, and as it is stated that Black Kats are unable to read, it is either was used by different spookats, or was such before the Kataclysm.

If knight had no skill of understanding Owlite tomes, he would be likely to recreate ill-usage of the tome, which does not fit to the presence of the <a href="https://wiki.spiralknights.com/Mystical_Tome_Stand#Mystical_Tome_Stand" target="_blank">mystical tome stand</a> and its <a href="https://wiki.spiralknights.com/File:Furniture-Mystical_Tome_Stand-Animated.png" target="_blank">behavior</a>. This pattern of magic, apart from Nature Sprite magic, in the context of the effect of the Dark Ritual is very similar to the white soul-like orbs drawn to the ritual site before the pink lightning strikes it. On the other hand, there is no unique furniture in the <a href="https://wiki.spiralknights.com/Moorcroft_Prize_Box" target="_blank">Moorcroft</a> or <a href="https://wiki.spiralknights.com/Guild_Hall_Prize_Box" target="_blank">Guild hall</a> prize boxes, like transmuted furniture, similar to Lord Vanaduke's Finery and mask, which on their own could not exist simultaneously as discussed in the [mask and finery section](). We proposed, that there is only one mask of Lord Vanaduke, one in his finery ith the lingering presence of Vog's curse. Based on this we could gather that the cursed tome is not a unique instance but rather a multitude of books, what is the stand is not unique in its existence, there are other cursed tomes.

Due to those factors, we propose, that the Book of Grey Feathers, as it was cursed by ill-usage and potentially other factors, is the Book of Dark Rituals, as then its rarity would be symbolically explained, as one of a kind.

The cursed tomes remain, as there is both possibility of those tomes being in possession of Kats both before their banishment, and after Kataclysm - both scenarios could explain them as follows:

- Kat tribe had to know of the magical properties of Owlite tomes, and, judging by animalistic behavior of Black Kats, they would have known it prior to Kataclysm, potentially even, attaining magical power, which could explain existence of evil eye symbolism of their derived armors, as in death, they continue, although mindlessly to consume those tomes.

  The fact that Seraphynx in the events of <a href="https://wiki.spiralknights.com/Angels_from_Antiquity" target="_blank">Angels from Antiquity</a> is found in the same chamber of an identical ritual circle as of Konjuring Kat, while being located in the <a href="https://wiki.spiralknights.com/Angels_from_Antiquity/Restless_Railroad" target="_blank">Restless Railroad</a>, and as it is transformed only recently, we can propose, that this innate Kat tribe property of seeking magic is a form of reincarnation of Kats through battle sprites, and not characteristic of a select few member of the Kat tribe: `I think these sprites are studying these old books. I didn't even know they could read!` (<a href="https://wiki.spiralknights.com/Angels_from_Antiquity/Restless_Railroad" target="_blank">Angels from Antiquity/Restless Railroad - Rhendon</a>).

- The cursed tomes are tempered by spookats of the Moorcroft Archives. Most of spookats are civil enough to run Moorcroft manor with accompanied railroad, so a distinction is then drawn.

  There are 3 fiendish sigils depicted on the left page of the cursed tomes on the stands. This means, in conjunction with the effects of interaction with the tome, that the nature of Margrel's summoning and of spookat by the furniture is fundamentally the same.

  It is also important to note, that Black Kats are explicitly summoned, and that is within the conditions of Cradle, wherein boundaries between realms are vague. This is most reminiscent of banished Legion of Ur. As Legion of Ur is also summoned through the sigils and ritual circles, we can conclude that all of those 3 instances are cases of the same metaphysical law.

Based on those arguments, we propose, that the prior scenario, - of Kat Tribe striving for the magic of the tomes, - is the more likely one.

#### Aftermath

Kataclysm had erased Owlites and valkyries, the entire heavenly kingdom, as seen by the state Scarlet Fortress is found in. We had proposed that the Academy was at the epicenter of the Kataclysm, considering its similarity to Graveyards, which are between material realm and Underworld. Based on the presence of spookats across clockworks, and more specifically, presence of spookats across castles, we can guess a potential scope of the operation, with Kat Tribe invading both the Academy and Scarlet fortress which we attribute to the heavenly kingdom, if not even its capital, in the same manner as among many citadels of Almire, we can explore only the Great Citadel at the center of Almire. In the Lockdown mode, one of the arenas - the Fortress, - is the Scarlet Fortress, but it is littered with ancient pages, similar to the occasional libraries of the black kat prestige missions.

This pattern of knights visiting the most important regions of civilizations may be applied to the earlier concept of the Grey Feather Tower being the center point of the Owlite Academy. Despite the fact earlier we suggested that the tower itself remain unseen, we do not know its fate. As far as the properties of cursed maelstrom go, judging by its known behavior in consideration of Grim Gates, Grey Feather Tower could be in a different realm altogether, as the Kataclysm did not erase Kats, but seemingly banished them into Underworld.

##### Dark Ritual and Nefarious Imp

We have stated earlier that the behavior of Cursed Tome Stand, presence of 3 fiendish sigils and summoning of Margrel are onf the same nature. Then we added to this pattern Legion of Ur, as its summoning is also achieved through the fiendish ritual circles. Trojans are supposedly summoned through fiendish sigils and ritual circles, while being banished, disallowing any other method of summoning. As Margrel and other Black Kats are summoned through the dark ritual, one party or at least one metaphysic law is applied in both cases. While Konjuring Kat may have summoned Margrel by accident, this is unknown of the other Black Kats, and is seemingly a desired outcome.

Considering the lack of relation of Konjuring Kat to devilites, and as those parties are not seem to be interacting, we can make a guess that is is the universal law of material realm and Underworld relation itself is what is seen here, but used by different parties - the summoning of banished - to Underworld, likely, - entities through the usage of ritual circles.

With this, we come to find a single inconsistency and one loose end: the dark portal from which Black Kats are summoned then could be either the one Pembrooke created, or, as he did it ba accident, a dark portal of grim gates, as that actor still remains unknown.

The only entity that would be interested in bringing Underworld closer to material realm would be the Nefarious Imp, which we had suspected to be one who was actually seeking for the book of dark rituals based on the word nefarious used in both instances. But then, Black Kats are described as `These shadowy beasts hunger for arcane power and are making another attempt to execute their nefarious plans. ... It appears that illiteracy is still rampant among the black kat hordes, so they have once more taken to eating the pilfered pages rather than using them for arcane rituals` ([Kataclysmic Confrontation!](https://forums.spiralknights.com/en/node/100025)) and `It seems the hordes of black kats have eaten their fill of magical pages, and they’re disappearing back into the shadows` ([Katastrophe Box Extended!](https://forums.spiralknights.com/en/node/100025#comment-914427)). The fact Kats disappear into shadows, may be of the same nature as of Grimalkin disappearing into shadows and also that they willingly disappear, rather than through banishment as Legion of Ur. We propose it being an act of plotting from the Underworld, similar to short raids onto material realm from the Underworld, rather than an un-life cycle of Black Kats, as other wise they have no reason to return to Underworld. We can exclude a case of their inability too exist in material realm for a prolonged periods of time, as spookats exit exactly as such in the Moorcroft Manor.

In that regard Dread Seal, the one also present on Carnavons is of greater interest. It is present on entities which seemingly remained in the material realm - Carnavons. Those also have a drawn curse symbol on their crests, blackened crests of Almire. We will return to the dread seal and its meaning later, until then we will suffice with the conclusion that dark ritual in question is the part of a connection between material realm and Underworld, a method to summon entities from the latter.

##### Warding Candles

At some point in time, blue warding candles were developed as they are present within the Keep, they are designed at ward off the darkness. This darkness is, supposedly, belongs to the Underworld (`A personal candle for warding off the darkness, and that which lurks within it` - <a href="https://wiki.spiralknights.com/Illuminating_Ward" target="_blank">Illuminating Ward</a>), which may suggest earlier attempts of Owlites to reach into the Underworld, same as Titans or Tortomega many years ago.

The candles were, quite possibly, developed during research of the Undead in relation to the Underworld's influence, as heavenly kingdom had experience with Almire's fiendish army and through existence of the Fallen Valkyrian. At the same time, as Nameless realm had to be discovered, the relating equipment had to be forbidden, seems as a significant characterization of the scope of other realm, to whose effects Owlites of heavenly kingdom in general had to prepared. One of those instances of utilizing and adapting curse, for example, is the further discussed <a href="https://wiki.spiralknights.com/Divine_Avenger" target="_blank">Divine Avenger</a> due to it possessing curse eys imagery.

#### Grimalkin

There are spookats, Black Kats, and far more powerful grimalkin. As with Owlites, we can only guess the anatomy of Kats. Based on their alchemized armor and the theme of conflict, they were capable of using many different types of weaponry, including an artillery (`A reclaimed raiment said to resemble the Kat Tribe hero, Preowa, whose artillery silenced the Grey Feather Tower Sages` - <a href="https://wiki.spiralknights.com/Kat_Eye_Raiment" target="_blank">Kat Eye Raiment</a>). The definition of artillery in that regard, we suggest, is unimportant, apart from a capacity to siege a tower, which makes it powerful enough for a real world counterparts.

In regards to military terms, Howlitzers, we had suggested, are inspired by howitzers, a german artillery. Kat Tribe is permanently obscured by the Kataclysm.

As we proposed that howlitzer are ancient dragons or drakes, their existence here can only be justified by the property of spirits returning to material realm, meaning that before Kataclysm howlitzers, or dragons or drakes, were buried in across the castle structures of heavenly kingdom, which would be a sign of their interaction in the past - referring to [the war of valkyries and dragons]().

Regular grimalkin encountered across Candlestick Keep arrive from the darkness and vulnerable to blue warding candles. It is likely grimalkin which are referred in the candle description: `candle for warding off the darkness, and that which lurks within it` (<a href="https://wiki.spiralknights.com/Illuminating_Ward" target="_blank">Illuminating Ward</a>).

Grimalkin in real-world is the term for a cat. But, due to cosmology of Spiral Knight, we propose, that the name itself by the prefix of "grim", similar to Underworld technology - grim gates and grim totems, and also grim mask of Isorian folklore, - relates to the Underworldly nature.

The fact warding candles are lit with embers, and Owlites are known to be vulnerable to fire, may suggest, the way we see it, that warding candles' powers are dependant on constant supply of embers. Considering Owlites' interest in Almire, and as we will discover in the [analysis of Shadow Firestorm Citadel](#true-citadel-of-almirian-empire), heavenly kingdom surrounds the Citadel, embers could in fact be derived from there.

Considering presence of Grimalkin only within the Academy, in addition to Margrel, we can make a guess that those are the Kats which were in the most proximity to the epicenter, in order to follow the differences between origins of Black Kats, grimalkin and the rest of spookats, - as a metaphysical change had to occur to them during the Kataclysm.

##### Maskeriath

In the context of Grimalkin and also here covered <a href="https://wiki.spiralknights.com/Phantom" target="_blank">phantoms</a>, we have to discuss Maskeriath battle sprite. Maskeraiths are similar to grimalkin by the fact of being ghost-like apparitions and being referred as wraiths (`These cursed wraiths cannot be destroyed and the only thing they truly fear is the light of the enchanted candles` - <a href="https://wiki.spiralknights.com/Candlestick_Keep#Lore" target="_blank">Information module - Candlestick Keep</a>). Apart from the naming convention, spookats and grimalkin resemble undead Kat tribe, compared to corporal Seraphynx. If Seraphynx represents Kat Tribe before the Kataclysm and Drakon of ancient dragons, where does Maskeriath fit, or rather, whom it embodies?

Here we have to look at the contents of <a href="https://wiki.spiralknights.com/Spritely_Prize_Box" target="_blank">Spritely Prize Box</a>, within which all of the rest battle sprite reskins are found. In case of Maskeriath there are 3 reskins, apart from the Grey Prize Box, which will be very important later: [Volcanic](<https://wiki.spiralknights.com/Maskeraith_(Volcanic)>), [Freeze](<https://wiki.spiralknights.com/Maskeraith_(Freeze)>), and [Snarblepup](<https://wiki.spiralknights.com/Maskeraith_(Snarblepup)>).

Phantoms and Grimalkin are similar due to being a permanent danger in the darkness of Underworld. Moreover, it is Margrel, who is transformed to grimalkin has the same curse properties of a phantom, including the pink color of curse.

Phantoms have a skull with a whirling soul inside it. There are a few other instances of this design - <a href="https://wiki.spiralknights.com/Estavio" target="_blank">Estavio</a> and <a href="https://wiki.spiralknights.com/Hector" target="_blank">Hector</a> residing in Moorcroft manor. In that regard we can attribute Vanaduke's Soul to the same type, as it is most clearly seen behind his mask, which, from a design perspective, importance of sculls for Grim Totems, and by the fact of being vulnerable spot, fits well into the established framework, as the container for the soul, to which it is seemingly bound, discussed earlier in the [context of Lord Vanaduke's passing](#vanadukes-mask-and-immortality-through-curse).

Maskeraith acquires properties of fiery deity as well as hail deity, manifested as two its variants, or in case of Hail deity being a false lead, the existence of everfrost and blinding abyss relation to Underworld, and re-imagines here seems to us as undeniable, as unnatural freeze and heat are two elements, apart from presence of Vile deity, which persist across much of equipment with those themes.

Snarblepup is less explicit in its conception. But, if we attempt to relate Maskeraith to Snarbolax's curse-ridden nature, maybe we could find more connections?

Maskeriath os not have ability to deal elemental damage with the crystal harness, but has piercing, golden harness. We have discussed how piercing damage and gold are paired in their divinity, as of metal and an applications of this damage type, and how crystal and elemental damage are paired though known metaphysics of souls within crystal, now with addition of the relation to the Nameless Realm and its combined elements.

The dark harness is called simply as that, dark, so not much information could be extracted from it. On the other hand, considering how dark damage is unnatural to the material realm, its creation could be as vague as the nature of the dark, being defined by Spiral Order biotechs only in such vague terms, meaning that the material of the harness is unknown. We can make a guess, based on many shadow damage type weapons and equipment, that shadow steel has a chance of being used here, mainly due to presence of other metal such as gold and iron, omitting elemental crystal harness.

Considering effects of dark matter, its relation to shadow damage, the very fact, dark matter is used to feed the sprite makes it a very unique in its own regard entity, on par with so called here reincarnation of past species such as Kats and Dragons through their according battle sprites.

Under this though framework the first though is the similarity of Maskeraith to grimalkin due to ghostly, or rather, ghastly appearance of both.

Here we can attempt to find similarities in sprite's evolution and other folklore:

- Tier 2 Maskeraith has a single centered horn, which remind of the <a href="https://wiki.spiralknights.com/Grim_Mask" target="_blank">Grim Mask</a>.
- The ghastly mask, attained by Haunted Haze ultimate ability has ony one eye lit, one smaller than the other. This asymmetric design is reminiscent of strangers.
- The entity behind Maskeraith design may be one depicted in the designs of the 5 star variants of the <a href="https://wiki.spiralknights.com/Shade_Helm" target="_blank">Shade Helm</a> which on its own refers to a concept of shade, as well as having similar head and eye shape.
- The Shadow Cloak ability is only one depicting a sprite across all of them, with one eye lit within the part of the face in the dark, with the other being in the light. It makes us think of the anatomical significance of the mask, with the previously established context of mask relating to the soul, which may also point to the nature of Maskeraith.
- The Vengeful Quills ultimate ability's design show as the quill looking reminiscent of luminite. Virulent Quills ultimate makes the quills seems as made of valestone with more pronounces green hue of the vile fiend costume set. The regular quills are of dak matter.
- Haunted Haze ultimate seemingly weaponizes souls in the similar fashion as Margrel summoning homing spiked orbs.
- Chaotic Haze ultimate can inflict curse and other status effects with no exceptions, contrast in to the <a href="https://wiki.spiralknights.com/Sealed_Sword" target="_blank">sealed sword</a> status infliction, yet devoid of curse, as it is sealed by the dread seal. During the initiation of the haze, ghosts are seen, which are likely the reason for the hex applied.

With all of those factors considered, we suggest, that Maskeraith seem to represent and entity, or several entities, if judged by the masks' shapes, inhabiting the Underworld, surpassing abilities of regular undead and fiends, and entering an area of such entities as Maulos, Arkus, and Lord Vanaduke, due a large set of skills, while preserving their general themes. This representation is not inherently evil, but rather demonstrates many different aspects of Underworld's nature, as it is deeply related to souls, curse, and to the ever-reaching chaotic nature of the supposed Nameless Realm.

#### Black Kats and Curse

Black kats can be studied from multiple perspectives: design, prestige missions, background information on Owlites, and from the derived knowledge about metaphysics of curse up until current point.

- Kataclysm brought Underworld's darkness, similar to one of graveyards, into material realm in surrounding Grey Feather Tower.
- Some units of the Kat tribe seem to be sealed somewhere, most likely Underworld: `Someone or something has summoned a horde of cursed Black Kats into the Clockworks. These shadowy beasts hunger for arcane power and raided the Moorcroft Manor Archives' precious collection of magical grimoires. In the wrong hands these ancient tomes could be catastrophic, but it turns out that Black Kats can't read, so they instead decided to just eat them. The residents of Moorcroft Manor would like you to retrieve the Ancient Pages of the magical grimoires that quite likely reside in the stomachs of Black Kats. We'll leave you to figure out just how to recover them` (<a href="https://forums.spiralknights.com/en/node/73222" target="_blank">Kataclysmic Confrontation</a>). Black Kats are explicitly said to be summoned. We concluded on the idea, that it is the same mechanism, which allowed for trojans to be summoned. While their role as ones surviving in undeath past the Kataclysm, someone had to summon them initially.

  Grimalkin inhabit places closest to the Underworld, such as Owlite Academy stuck in the same state as Graveyards, between dimensions: `Graveyards are an unnatural place, a world between worlds where lost souls gather, hungry for the life of any live soul that must pass through`. Grimalkin are similar to Phantoms as they can be stopped only temporality.

- All black kats and Margrel possess powers of curse.
- Summoning of Margrel introduces a giant maelstrom enveloping entirety of the Moorcroft manor, the same as one seen across malfunctioned grim gates but magnitudes larger.

Through these characteristics a nature of Kataclysm could be narrowed: one of opening a portal into the Underworld, whose influence poured into the material realm, consuming the closest of living entities within itself due to sheer scale.

Based on earlier quote it seems that Black Kats are different from the rest by their relation and bearing of curse, that they were already cursed when summoned, instead of becoming such through consumption of magical grimoires. This could be a potential precedent for them being sealed same time later after the Kataclysm, - different scenario, instead of a permanent annihilation of all heavenly kingdom.

This can be also affirmed by a following idea - if trojans were sealed by heavenly kingdom, as the Fallen was banished into the Underworld, the ability to seal Black Kats and to summon them back is one likely attributed to those who already used it - Owlite of heavenly kingdom. This would also explain the time when warding candles were invented, as no other darkness, apart from graveyard's, wherein candles were seem, was present at that time.

But, this would contradict an idea that graveyards became such only when they arrived in proximity of the Core, as prior to the metaphysical change of Cradle, those were regular graveyards, as then SPiral Order would be aware of this unnatural presence.

Presence of Void Souls inside the Core seems as the strong argument in favour a theory of the Core, rather that the Kataclysm, being responsible for the local metaphysics, due to how alien both Whitespace and the Swarm are in relation to even the curse. In that regard, Core could accelerate the notions already present, in the form of haunted passages, for example, as well as cause seemingly unpredictable behavior, such as transformation of battle sprites.

In particular, a transcendence to different types of damage, lacking of normal damage is confirmed by <a href="https://wiki.spiralknights.com/Hahn" target="_blank">Hahn</a>: `You have a strange definition of recreation if that's the case. Tier 3 fiends and undead are nothing to sneeze at, in fact they're among the worst creatures you'll find so close to the Core. Devilite management seems to be the worst at these depths and that results in some very violent devilites. ... Exactly, and they're worse now. And the same goes for the undead. You'll find that howlitzers become particularly bothersome with their enhanced firing and homing capabilities. Lastly, prepare for fiend and undead monsters to potentially deal pure shadow damage` (<a href="https://wiki.spiralknights.com/Darkest_Forces" target="_blank">Darkest Forces - Hahn</a>).

Considering this, we can place period when Philoso made most of his advancement into the very end of Owlite civilization, as then presence of undead would be justified, as well as invention of devices against Underworld's darkness, as well as most of end-game high-performance equipment, such as Chaos Cloak. Also, considering the time scale we operate in, most of Owlite-related equipment does align to a period closer to Kat tribe, rather that anything else, apart from a supposed Forgotten Time earlier in the timeline.

In that regard, <a href="https://wiki.spiralknights.com/Divine_Mantle" target="_blank">Divine Mantle</a> has curse resistance and is attributed to Owlites, could be of a more recent development, when Owlites had already encountered the curse, and with its direct knowledge developed such equipment, relating back to heavenly kingdom.

##### Margrel and Immortality <span class="through-curse">Through Curse</span>

As for the Kat Tribe knowledge of curse, the fact their alchemized armor is one bearing evil eye symbolism - we can look at a different example of an alchemized equipment from an extinct civilization:

- Almirian Crusader armor is completely restored only by traversing shadow lairs.
- Ancient Plate armor which we had attributed to titans - tortomega, - has a unique health boost both in function and in description of the perk.
- Owlite robes, specifically <a href="https://wiki.spiralknights.com/Chaos_Cloak" target="_blank">Chaos Cloak</a>, despite Owlite being erased from existence, has antique evil eye design on its garb.
- Valkyrian armors connected to resistance to curse.

Based on those instances, it seems that Spiral Order had not performed much modifications to the original designs. We can conclude that kat Tribe had already known of the curse before the Kataclysm. This, of course, could suggest a scenario similar to Snarbolax and Lord Vanaduke - the case of an unnatural immortality through curse, referring in the most direct form to Margrel, as he gained more powers of the Underworld from the act of being summoned.

The last element if the pink lightning striking Margrel's ritual site when it is summoned. We suggest it being a sign of Underworld's presence, as across myth's lightning strike was associated with the presence of the supernatural, or more commonly, divine presence. Considering similar lightning in case of Arkus, we can suggest that he, through partial transformation to the trojan, and one far more powerful, was tapping into the Underworld's literal energy. As for Sparks of Life - as those are already discrete quantities of energy, enough to revive, presence of lightning could seem as a design choice. And yet, it is accompanied by falling dust, similar to the presence of the Swarm. This seems as a different instance of signaling energy's presence through blue lightning, its excess, symbolized by the temporary attack buff.

##### Inversion of Curse

It is here a concept of inverted curse should be brought up. Golden evil eye present on the <a href="https://wiki.spiralknights.com/Divine_Avenger" target="_blank">Divine Avenger</a> is of heavenly kingdom, or more specifically, of Owlite research. The Avenger and Faust both have a curse symbolism, a shape encompassing the evil eye is one of <a href="https://wiki.spiralknights.com/Dread_Seal" target="_blank">Dread Seal</a>. In case of Avenger, color is inverted to gold. But it belong to an age when Valkyries invaded Underworld, as it would require valkyries to encounter it properly to gain such deep understanding of curse and its symbol, in order to wield it.

Divine <a href="https://wiki.spiralknights.com/Divine_Veil" target="_blank">Veil</a> has <a href="https://wiki.spiralknights.com/Silverweave" target="_blank">Silverweave</a> woven in it. Silverweave is described as: `A length of understated cloth intricately interwoven with precious metal. its tastefully ostentatious, yet prudently protective` (<a href="https://wiki.spiralknights.com/Silverweave" target="_blank">Silverweave</a>). Considering its usage in alchemy, we can make a guess that the precious metal in question is <a href="https://wiki.spiralknights.com/Sun_silver" target="_blank">Sun Silver</a>. Sun Silver is used in <a href="https://wiki.spiralknights.com/Divine_Avenger" target="_blank">Divine Avenger</a> as well as <a href="https://wiki.spiralknights.com/Miracloth" target="_blank">Miracloth</a>.

Miracloth is relevant to the <a href="https://wiki.spiralknights.com/Miracle_Cloak" target="_blank">Miracle armor</a>:

- <a href="https://wiki.spiralknights.com/Miracle_Hood" target="_blank">Miracle Hood</a>: `A miraculous mask said to grant a single miracle to the wearer when they need it most. In practice, it'll likely save your skin more often than that`.
- <a href="https://wiki.spiralknights.com/Miracle_Cloak" target="_blank">Miracle Cloak</a>: `A miraculous mantle said to grant a single miracle to the wearer when they need it most`.

All of the alchemy branch has an elemental motif: magic, elemental, miracle, and chaos, accompanied by divine. All of those characteristics, we suggest, relate to the nature of Nameless Realm, as one containing within itself also curse, as seen by other instances of chaotic motif. We have to keep this concept in mind, but currently, it reminds us most of the one other concept - an alchemical primal matter, originated from the round chaos of the void, from which world proper was created.

While the void will be discussed later, of course, it is the very one mentioned in the very beginning in relation to the Swarm, Nameless Realm is what is in the focus of this discussion. We have to keep nature of Nameless Realm as a potential alchemical candidate for the originating place of all matter, but we still do not know anything in regards to the in-universe Void. So this is the concept we must keep in mind.

#### Moorcroft Manor Past Heavenly Kingdom

Remaining spookats, now undead, establish the Moorcroft Manor within one of Owlite castles, where they move rest of recovered artifacts, including the <a href="https://wiki.spiralknights.com/Cursed_Tome_Stand#Cursed_Tome_Stand" target="_blank">Book of Grey Feathers</a> defiled by Margrel as well as other tomes: <a href="https://wiki.spiralknights.com/Tome_of_Rage" target="_blank">Tome of Rage</a> and <a href="https://wiki.spiralknights.com/Mystical_Tome_Stand#Mystical_Tome_Stand" target="_blank">Mythical Tome</a>: `A podium displaying a magical tome filled with arcane symbols, esoteric formulae, and (a) few particularly rude doodles`.

While Tome stands were covered, Tome of Rage is of particular interest to us due to a symbol of alchemy in its cover. Is symbol of alchemy also universal? As alchemy is used by Spiral Order for many years, and as energy seems to be universal, the symbol of alchemy is present across many locations, mainly in the form of alchemy station, including one in the Sanctuary - most remote location of all known to date, apart from the Apocrean Realm bleeding onto material realm, but also, alchemy orbs. Considering nature of the latter as catalysts for the transmutation itself, it is the philosopher's stone - the results of the Great Work, allowing for any matter to be transmuted into different matter. So are alchemy orbs also universal, or they are unique to Cradle?

The Moorcroft Manor became the main hub for less hostile of spookats. There, a ritual site was established and taken hold of by <a href="https://wiki.spiralknights.com/Konjuring_Kat" target="_blank">Konjuring Kat</a> for banished grimalkin to be summoned, utilizing same fiendish sigils made from Moonstone, with several attempts by far resulting in <a href="https://wiki.spiralknights.com/Kataclysmic_Confrontation" target="_blank">Kataclysmic Confrontation</a>, but with the presence of the tomes from Owlite libraries, - as much of ancient texts and levels connects back to Owlite academy, a different approach could be taken: of summoning banished to the Underworld Kat Tribe kats through powers of Nameless Realm, studied by Owlites.

Ritual site, when activated, has similar effects of light orbs as the <a href="https://wiki.spiralknights.com/Moorcroft_Furniture#Animations" target="_blank">Mystical Tome Stand</a>. The usage of sigils in ritual circles, summoning, and overall design may confirm them being of same role as the Solomon Keys, specifically of Book 1, and connecting with the Underworld.

Though Margrel summoning site is not made of dark matter, but of fiends only has lightning as Arkus attack, sigils themselves and same graviton/curse-colored swirl before Margrel is summoned, bearing similarity to closing portals of Grim Gates.

The entire plot of Margrel, as well as of Nefarious Imp relation to it must still be kept in mind. Margrel is summoned by accident but bears dread curse seal as the rest of Black Kats and Carnavons of Almire. The Konjuring kat does not seem as the nefarious entity referred by the <a href="https://wiki.spiralknights.com/Book_of_Dark_Rituals" target="_blank">Book of Dark Rituals</a>: `Just like any cursed tome, there is likely some twisted individual out there who wants it for extremely nefarious purposes`, which adds a point to devilites being this actors, if not the Imp himself, behind the Black Kat plot. Someone had to place this dread seal in the same manner as elemental Lumbers possess it.

#### Seraphynx

We believe, as Drakon became reincarnation of dragons, so Seraphynxs became reincarnations of Black Kats of Kat Tribe before their banishment. This process has resulted in resemblance of Kat Tribe with heavenly powers of valkyries. And yet, identities of Kat tribe resurface as these sprites are yet again drawn to Owlite tomes: `I think these sprites are studying these old books. I didn't even know they could read!` (<a href="https://wiki.spiralknights.com/Angels_from_Antiquity/Restless_Railroad" target="_blank">Angels from Antiquity/Restless Railroad - Rhendon</a>), specifically in a location looking particularly the same as the one in the Moorcroft Manor inhabited by the <a href="https://wiki.spiralknights.com/Konjuring_Kat" target="_blank">Konjuring Kat</a>.

- <a href="https://wiki.spiralknights.com/Katastrophe_Returns_Prize_Box" target="_blank">Katastrophe Prize Box</a> has both banished Kat tribe accessories and Valkyries', except for regular themed items.
- [Seraphynx (Black Kat)](<https://wiki.spiralknights.com/Seraphynx_(Black_Kat)>) has all the signs of banished Kat tribe, plus characteristics of Owlites' biology, specifically <a href="https://wiki.spiralknights.com/Prismatic_Seraph%27tenna" target="_blank">Prismatic Seraph'tenna</a>, and equipment of valkyrie armor: <a href="https://wiki.spiralknights.com/Prismatic_Dazzling_Gem" target="_blank">Prismatic Dazzling Gem</a>, <a href="https://wiki.spiralknights.com/Prismatic_Heavenly_Halo" target="_blank">Prismatic Heavenly Halo</a>, and prismatic wings (<a href="https://wiki.spiralknights.com/Wings" target="_blank">Wings</a>).

This makes me think that the Kataclysm was the same grim portal, - the maelstrom of curse, - but on a far larger scale, whose size had allowed for the known aftermath. This could explain total erasure of Owlites and transformation or banishment of Kat tribe, transforming the rest in to the spookats and grimalkin. But through [Seraphynx](#seraphynx) it is more or less known how kats have looked originally, moreover having divine attributes to them, or sharing them with Owlites and Valkyries, embodying this period of time.

<h3 align="center">Intermission: Analysis of Curse</h3>

Before we move on the analysis of Gremlin Empire, specifically nature of the complex network of connections between the Core, Whitespace, and the Swarm, with an addition of Sleeper and the Void, we are required to cover everything we now know of the phenomenon of Curse up until this point with a few exceptions from the next chapter. We will attempt to summarize all of its properties and patterns based on the established narratives and reasonable implications, observed across the timeline up until this point.

Symbol of the eye, <a href="https://wiki.spiralknights.com/Dread_Seal" target="_blank">dread seal</a> and symbol of curse within status effects classification of Spiral Order all have similar designs, which can be summarized as a an opened human eye with 3 strokes below it in radial pattern.

This design is similar to the Hand of Fatima or Eye of Miriam, which in its most common form is shaped like a hand with three extended fingers in the middle and a curved thumb and pinky fingers on the sides. Here, it seem to possess an inverted effect within the Spiral Knights cosmology.

Another potential inspiration for eye's design is prominent presence of the particular <a href="https://zelda.fandom.com/wiki/Eye_Symbol" target="_blank">eye symbol</a> across Legend of Zelda setting. While it is also hypothesized to be inspired eye of Horus, as the evil eye of Spiral Knights, the potential notion of the prior serving as an inspiration for the latter is plausible due to at least one inspiration from a different game: `Haven's original look resembled something similar to a Ald'ruhn from The Elder Scrolls: Morrowind. As you might imagine, it really didn't look right. Thank goodness we hired Cory!` (<a href="https://forums.spiralknights.com/en/node/20773" target="_blank">10 things you didn't know about Spiral Knights</a>).

As most os instances of curse are connected to Underworld and depictions of the evil eye, those will be covered first.

- For the first time, evil eye is seen as a color pattern on <a href="https://wiki.spiralknights.com/Greaver" target="_blank">Greavers' wings</a>.
  - Elemental Greavers have the pattern glowing in accordance to their elemental theme and status effect, apart from the curse itself.
  - Greavers have metal helms with evil eye as the visor, which we proposed to be a design across legions of Underworld.
- <a href="https://wiki.spiralknights.com/Tortodrone" target="_blank">Tortodrones' shell plates</a> have evil eye carved on them, possessing a red glow in enraged state, and purple when they are powered by dark matter while in enraged state.
  - The same evil eye is seen on <a href="https://wiki.spiralknights.com/Ancient_Shell" target="_blank">tortodrone shell-derived gear</a>, but in multiple colors, based on the mineral at the base of the transmutation. Red hue and purple hue of evil eye on the ancient plates of active tortodrones corresponds to a type of mineral powering its pistons - crimsonite and dark matter. The rest of minerals are encountered within transmuted gear.
- Graviton <a href="https://wiki.spiralknights.com/Graviton_Bomb" target="_blank">Bomb</a> has a physical symbol of an antique evil eye carved on it. The explosion of the bomb resembles the grim gate's opened portal vortex, without leading to dark city, presumably located within the Underworld. The vortex is then followed by an explosion with an imagery of evil eye, in the same patter to the grim gates.
  - Similar vortex resulting of the explosion is present in <a href="https://wiki.spiralknights.com/File:Exploration-Fiend_Gate.png" target="_blank">Grim Gates</a> during their portal collapse, but this instance has presence of curse pouring from Underworld.
  - Presence of Margrel is characterized by the the latter case of the maelstrom of curse pouring from the Underworld and a location wherein Black Kats were sealed.
- Antique evil eye in present on <a href="https://wiki.spiralknights.com/File:Exploration-Heavy_Statue.png" target="_blank">heavy statues</a>. They have troika-like weapon and helm in shape resembling a devilite, with an aforementioned single eye.
  - evil eye symbol is seen on the titans of the titan arcade gates. We concluded tat the statue and titan are the same entity, as well as tortomega, descendants of dragons.
- Snarbolax is cursed, but has it contained within its fur, which grants it its defenses and ability to exist and haunt after death.
- <a href="https://wiki.spiralknights.com/Nefarious_Raiment" target="_blank">Nefarious Imp raiment</a> and <a href="https://wiki.spiralknights.com/Nefarious_Hood" target="_blank">hood</a> have highly advanced designs incorporating a more abstract version of evil eye imagery with lines on sides on an eye.
  - That armor, helm specifically, has a glowing symbol of evil eye similar to <a href="https://wiki.spiralknights.com/Gran_Faust" target="_blank">Gran Faust</a>.
  - Same advanced shape was seen on Gran Faust and Faust guards.
- A rotated antique evil eye is depicted within the cloth pattern of the Chaos Cloak, connected to the Nameless Realm.
- The dread seal contains image of the evil eye.
  - Dread Seal is present on <a href="https://wiki.spiralknights.com/Carnavon#Carnavon" target="_blank">Carnavons</a>, warriors of Almire. Their bear similar concentrated degree of curse as Black Kats, their claws are of dark matter form the supposed influence of darkfire - merging or Underworld's curse and Vog's curse into a single phenomenon.
    - <a href="https://wiki.spiralknights.com/Darkfire_Vanaduke" target="_blank">Darkfire Vanaduke</a> has same dark matter claws, and is immortal, while being maddened, cursed by the fiery deity Vog.
  - The Seal is also present on <a href="https://wiki.spiralknights.com/Margrel" target="_blank">Margrel</a>, in addition, <a href="https://wiki.spiralknights.com/Black_Kat#Black_Kat" target="_blank">black kats</a> being both summoned (<a href="https://wiki.spiralknights.com/Kataclysmic_Confrontation" target="_blank">1</a>, <a href="https://wiki.spiralknights.com/Book_of_Dark_Rituals" target="_blank">2</a>) - the former are summoned all across known Clockworks and Margrel is summoned through a <a href="https://wiki.spiralknights.com/Book_of_Dark_Rituals" target="_blank">dark ritual</a>
    - <a href="https://wiki.spiralknights.com/Mewkat#Mewkat" target="_blank">Mewkats</a> are closely related to black kats as both being grimalkin transformed into Undead - a parallel to citizens and legion of Almire.
    - <a href="https://wiki.spiralknights.com/Mewkat#Grimalkin" target="_blank">Grimalkin</a> emerge in areas covered by an unnatural darkness, one being related to Underworld through Philoso's research of Undead
      - Research of Undead was possibly performed by Titans before discovery of Underworld proper
  - [Seraphynx, Black Kat](<https://wiki.spiralknights.com/Seraphynx_(Black_Kat)#Gallery>) battle sprite transformed by the Core has the same Seal present under certain conditions of evolution, combining divinity of heavenly kingdom and curse-aligned nature of post-Kataclysm Kat tribe.
- <a href="https://wiki.spiralknights.com/Trojan" target="_blank">Trojans</a>, including Arkus have dark matter crystal, trojans of tier 3 and resurrected Arkus have the crystal and inner essence burning in the same purple flame.
  - The purple flame is also characterized by <a href="https://wiki.spiralknights.com/Dark_Ember" target="_blank">Dark Embers</a>
  - Trojans and corrupted tortodrones petrify once the dark matter inside is destroyed, releasing purple mist of less concentrated dark matter.
  - <a href="https://wiki.spiralknights.com/The_Return_of_Ur" target="_blank">Trojans were sealed in the Underworld</a>
  - <a href="https://wiki.spiralknights.com/Dreadnaught" target="_blank">Dreadnaughts</a> can inflict curse while being not a curse-ridden entities, but they are linked through resurrection to grim totems
  - Apocrea, while without evil eye symbolism, is an entity of shadow damage and possible Underworld, with similar futuristic design as Nefarious Imp armor yet without sign of curse present within.
  - Trojans, Black Kats, and Margrel are all summoned through the dark ritual of fiendish sigil, ritual circles of minerals, and a text, used to initiate the summoning.
- Explicit curse seals forbid some of abilities of a sealed entity.
  - <a href="https://wiki.spiralknights.com/Firestorm_Citadel/Charred_Court" target="_blank">Cursed Nature Sprites</a> could not establish a link to Spirit Mother and its realm.
  - Curse placed on Knight disallows it to inflict damage.
  - Curse Seal and curse-afflicting attacks of of <a href="https://wiki.spiralknights.com/Margrel" target="_blank">Black Kats</a> may symbolize their banishment or punishment, explicitly hostile to everyone.
  - Curse Seal on <a href="https://wiki.spiralknights.com/Sealed_Sword" target="_blank">Sealed Sword</a> restricts its power output
  - Curse Seal on Lumbers (apart from void lumbers, they lack the seal) hides the essence which might power the tree trunk, sealing it within and pilot the mechanical part, explicitly hostile to knights.

Entities imbued with curse last far longer under unnatural means and have amplified power compared to their nature prior to being afflicted with curse:

- Vanaduke or Darkfire Vanaduke, Margrel, black kats, carnavons, trojans live for more than thousand of years and inflict curse.
- In some instances they are resistant to curse: devilites and Vanaduke, fiends (a possible connection to lack of fiends in the consumed horde of the Swarm within the Unknown Passage).
- Armors and gear explicitly related to Underworld and curse of their owners are weak to curse, while items related to divinity are strongly resistant to curse.

In relation to gremlins, gremlin technology and Clockworks:

- <a href="https://wiki.spiralknights.com/Collector" target="_blank">the Collector</a> has antique evil eye drawn around its central eye, and backpack of bombs has the sigil with the eye
  - <a href="https://wiki.spiralknights.com/Lumber" target="_blank">Lumber</a> created by gremlins have paper seals placed onto them, the same sealed sword is wrapped in.
    - Lumbers drop essences of 4 elements, same as Mewkats. Although this could be thematic feature for the sake of loot table consistency of tier 3.
  - Collectors backpack has the same symbol as echo blocks, which also contain a depiction of an eye.
- The Swarm has a similar eye <a href="https://wiki.spiralknights.com/Dreams_and_Nightmares/The_Path_is_Revealed" target="_blank">pointing downwards</a>
  - Core's enemy onslaught <a href="https://wiki.spiralknights.com/Dreams_and_Nightmares/A_Step_Beyond" target="_blank">gates</a> have evil eye present of same curse-themed color of dark pink and purple, with an iris of larger size.
  - Core's respawn pads have 3 dots, similar to 3-dot eye of Apocrea of Underworld and Scarabs.

#### Metaphysical Restriction

The curse can be externally applied, which takes form of a metaphysic restriction placed upon an entity, such as Cursed Nature Sprites, or a knight with an inability to attack.

A different kind of restriction manifests through application of a seal, in a most basic form, as seen on elemental lumbers and Sealed Sword, it restricts the function of an object, and, as with lumbers seem to tether a soul to a corporeal body. A more advanced usage of the seal is seen through presence of the Dread Seal, placed onto Carnavons and Black Kats.

A more nuanced relation of curse and constructs is seen in tortodrones, whose shell hides charged crimsonite and may be a potential ritual circle or a seal to contain it. In case of corrupted tortodrones, due to presence of dark matter, a more advanced method of containment is used - that os ritual circle sigils. Despite this difference, all of the above instances are attributed to the capacity of curse to restrict.

#### Physical Transformation

The more curse is integrated into nature of an affected entity, the more this entity approaches the nature of Underworld, going through a process of transformation of a body but not and of a souls, the prior in the lower realm is malleable, as suggested by emergence of gorgos.

Those entities are trojans of legion of Ur, Arkus, and Lord Vanaduke's. If the bearer of the curse was dead, the soul would leave it, with only traces remaining, but on Cradle it is tethered to a body through external means, which we had concluded being the presence of the Core, rather than Kataclysm. This process of bounding of a souls for constructs is achieved though application of a seal, described above. It seems that the seal has the same property as Owlite texts, through presence of specific symbol, which by the fact of being written, grant the underlying matter power across multiple realms. Same can be thought of the fiendish ritual circles, as their pattern defines their properties and function.

The curse can be transformed into a heavenly magic, as seen in the Divine Avenger, and incorporated, or likely, is present in shadow steel or other Underworld material, as seen in Gran Faust.

Yet, in its nature, curse is natural. it is an essential element of Underworld, which is perceived as curse in the material realm due to differences of laws of physics between those realms.

#### Immortality

In greater scope, it is a sign of relation to shadow damage, seen in such instances as Kat Tribe raiments and Collector's eye and explosion, which is reminiscent of the graviton and electron bombs.

In that interpretation and arising notion, before delving into the Swarm, the curse has a tendency of giving greater power and flawed immortality in exchange for the change in nature of said beings, aligning them with the Underworld, fiends and darkness.

The fiends themselves are immune to it and incorporate it to the extremes as part of their biology and nature, as seen in greavers. Entities which incorporate <a href="https://wiki.spiralknights.com/Curse" target="_blank">curse</a> to the fullest are weak to piercing or celestial/divine damage originating from Heavens, contained in the refined <a href="https://wiki.spiralknights.com/Celestial_Ore" target="_blank">Celestial Ore</a> - <a href="https://wiki.spiralknights.com/Sun_Silver" target="_blank">Sun Silver</a>.

Presence of the Celestial Ore and Sun Silver highlights the widespread presence in the material realm. It is the nature of Heavens which lies at their properties. The celestial, heavenly theme originates from the Nameless Realm or the realm Sprite Mother exists, it is the origin of souls and auras, which are the concrete cases of universal medium of energy, emerging from crystal and mist energy. This energy flows from the upper nameless realm, settles in the material realm, and souls, after death of a host, depart into the Underworld. Within it, Apocrean Realm, Underworld proper and Blinding Abyss are all sustained by souls, or the energy.

Due to this, it is the universality of energy which grants immortality, binding through curse a soul - a pocket of energy - to a corporeal body, allowing it to be animated indefinitely. Lingering of a souls manifests as shadow damage, as it is directed by an undeparted soul, with the body being a physical actor.

#### Alchemical Transmutation

The thematic duality of chaos and nothingness is most present in dark matter mineral and Nameless Realm. Through this duality, curse is disregarded as any other natural phenomenon, one conforming to alchemical transmutation and laws of the universe.

The theme of this duality will be explored in the next section, fully deriving from alchemical meaning.

So it is established how curse manifests itself in the material realm. What if this concept to be expanded upon by asking a single question: how would curse manifest itself, if it to be presented to the Nameless Realm? How this concept of metaphysical restriction would behave itself when introduced to physics of a realm, which is the source of all energy, the foundation of the universe and souls? How this pocket of energy would be transformed, if taken in account such entities as Snarbolax, Lord Vanaduke, Margrel, and Maulos, or even phantoms, who are all tangible entities native to material realm?

<h3 align="center">Chapter <code>IX</code>: Gremlin Empire</h3>

Across the analysis we were noting different elements of gremlin technology, society, and what came of them. But in order to attain the fullest and deepest understanding of gremlin civilization, we need to analyze its history from several different perspectives in the similar manner as our previous discussions regarding tortomega, devilite, Isorian, and Owlite civilizations. Here, with all of the knowledge of those histories, which were eventually incorporated into Cradle, we can begin to arrange them within the context of Cradle and Clockworks.

#### Great Colony and Iron Law

We begin with the Great Colony. Most of the general and relatively direct trivia regarding gremlin civilization's past is found in Haven from Strangers as well as from a few other places. But, due to nature of the sources, a supposed gremlin king Tinkinzar is mentioned, whose validity of existence yet has to be discussed. Currently, we are concerned with the position of the Great Colony within gremlin society.

- `Emberlight founded by Gremlin outcasts from Great Colony. Gremlins of Emberlight not obey the Iron Law, so flee or die. We start over with Emberlight. New colony home to few of us: most ex-schemers, some merchants, some fighters, all traitors in the eyes of Great Colony Gremlins` (<a href="https://wiki.spiralknights.com/Pakrat#Dialogue" target="_blank">Pakrat</a>).
- `All gremlins belonging to the colony serve King Tinkinzar. Tinkinzar is said to be a great ruler and mechanical genius, responsible for the vision of the whole Clockworks. It is our understanding however that the kind is never seen by common gremlins, but instead his orders are delivered and carried out by his Crimson Order, a fearful and zealous band of gremlins who alone share audience with the great king` (<a href="https://wiki.spiralknights.com/Bootshuze#Dialogue" target="_blank">Bootshuze</a>).

  We have to keep in mind, that a potential element of unreliability might be present here through the wording of `Tinkinzar is said to be` and `It is our understanding`

- `Tinkinzar not seen for many many years. Crimson Order carries out Tinkinzar's plans for Cradle. Emberlight was blight on master plan because built by outcasts. Haven was probably the same, founded by non-Gremlins. Not part of plan!` (<a href="https://wiki.spiralknights.com/Pakrat#Dialogue" target="_blank">Pakrat</a>).
- `We believe they are developing some kind of weeping they're calling 'Project R' that will be targeting Haven itself. Spiral HQ and the Strangers themselves are requesting that you investigate the matter given your performance in the Royal Jelly Palace` (<a href="https://wiki.spiralknights.com/An_Explosive_Plot" target="_blank">An Explosive Plot - Kora</a>).
- `Project R appears to be in fact two massive weapons known as the 'Roarmulus Twins.' Designed by one of the Crimson Order itself, the Roarmulus Twins are some kind of construct cannon that the gremlins intend on moving up the Clockworks into the Haven Arcade!` (<a href="https://wiki.spiralknights.com/Target_Acquired" target="_blank">Target Acquired - Kora</a>).
- `A village of outcasts, Emberlight serves as a refuge for gremlins who were banished from the Great Colony. Now they live humble lives, selling wares and repairs to passing travelers, always fearful that one day the gremlin king Tinkinzar would see fit to wipe them out entirely` (<a href="https://wiki.spiralknights.com/Emberlight" target="_blank">Emberlight</a>).

  Here it is said that Tinkinzar is still present and directly oversees the plan, mentioned by Pakrat.

- `A very convincing costume that makes the wearer look like a gremlin. its so convincing, you just might receive an invitation to the Colony!` (<a href="https://wiki.spiralknights.com/Gremlin_Disguise" target="_blank">Gremlin Disguise</a>). The colony wih the capital C refers here to the Great Colony, as no other settle of an implied scope was established.
- `The Iron Law is Broken! The Crimson Order is False! The Nine are blind, they cannot see the Truth that lies below. The Nine are deaf, they cannot hear the Resonance that beats within this world. Herex no longer serves as one of the Nine. Only Herex sees and hears the Truth. Only Herex will prevail. Follow Herex and you will be spared` ([Spark And Roar - Hidden Hideout - Herex: Danger Module](https://wiki.spiralknights.com/Danger_Module:_Hidden_Hideout)). Here we are interested only in the nature of the ron Law.

Now we can outline basic relations:

- A state of Great Colony and relative order is maintained through the concept of Iron Law.
- As gremlins of Great Colony serve King Tinkinzar, they also obey the Iron law, which fits the idea of Great Colony gremlin considering the rest as traitors.
- The Iron Law, based of Herex's information and his overview of this concept, seem to suggest that, apart from Crimson Order enforcing and upholding it, the Law itself is a tangible concept within the greater scheme of relations, which involve Herex's plans. Based on this, we can conclude that the very idea of the Law being uprooted would also be considered a betrayal. The validity of the Law itself bing true is not yet questioned here, but rather it allows us to understand basic idea behind governance of gremlins.
- An idea of a master plan exists, which is allegedly devised by Tinkinzar and enforced by Crimson Order within the grand context of Cradle. Under this directive existence of Emberlight is harmful to Plan's execution.

To summarize those points, due to unknown nature of this plan, the validity of the claim, that Emberlight's existence could harm it, creates at least 2 interpretations, distinguished mainly by the degree of false information being distributed across non-Crimson Order gremlins, which, considering general dystopian inspiration, does seem as a valid assumption:

- Iron Law is devised with the entire understanding of Cradle and Clockworks, as well as nature of the Core, if Herex is to be believed.
- Iron Law is a form of suppression of any state outside of Great Colony and distinct clans. Herex's presence in this interpretation would seem as if Crimson Order itself now considers the Law truthful or is unaware of its false nature.

We will keep his idea in mind until our analysis of Crimson Order. There is one more conflicting interpretation of the term Great Colony, which we will hold off until the analysis of the [mending rune](#mending-rune-and-gremlin-emblem). Until then we will consider Great Colony as a literal location.

As we have not heard of gremlins in the context of other civilizations, we can make a plausible explanation for it being the fact that those periods of time were prior to incorporation into Cradle. But it unknown weather Cradle is as old as those civilizations - are Clockworks as old as, for example, heavenly kingdom or tortomega even in two of the latter were not yet taken into Clockworks? If gremlins are to be considered one of the more technologically advanced civilizations to date on par with urban occult setting of devilites, [represented as unknown Undercorp](), [heavenly kingdom of valkyries]() with [Owlite Academy](), and [Almire](), - gremlins, through Clockworks, had managed to connect all of the above despite lingering existential threats within each epoch.

Based on the quote `Tinkinzar is said to be a great ruler and mechanical genius, responsible for the vision of the whole Clockworks` (<a href="https://wiki.spiralknights.com/Bootshuze#Dialogue" target="_blank">Bootshuze</a>) we have to assume that Tinkinzar came before Clockworks and subsequently Cradle. Yet, it is due Pakrat's recount of events it is known that a many years had passed since one saw the king: `Tinkinzar not seen for many many years. Crimson Order carries out Tinkinzar's plans for Cradle` (<a href="https://wiki.spiralknights.com/Pakrat#Dialogue" target="_blank">Pakrat</a>). Based in this information already we believe that Tinkinzar is far older than it might be expected of gremlin specie. We have made such conclusion based on the phrasing Pakrat uses, as if Tinkinzar was still present in the past but after Pakrat was born. We will return to a different interpretation of the king within the analysis of Crimson Order, but currently, we have to consider this time discrepancy as an argument if favour of our explanation of events of ghost in The Machine and unresolved existence of laser technology.

So, this idea of a assumed to be immortal king also ties in with a concept, first established during the [analysis of Ghost in The Machine danger mission](#ghosts-in-the-machine), - that Ironclaw Munitions Factory is the assembly line for not only Roarmulus Twins but other technology, specifically shock-themed lasers, the same ones present on Big Iron battlepod. [This battlepod secures the bridge of Isorian Vessel in the Iron Hulk](#ghosts-in-the-machine). This large time span is based of the fact the bodies of space jockeys to that point had turned to dust, haunting the space vessel, while gremlins had to contain in in the Dry Docks with their own machinery, primarily mecha knights.

Then there is the name of Great Colony. Great Colony can be characterized as gremlin capital in a general sense, based of the known clans and depths, but disregarding a possibility of a greater scope entity, as none was currently presented. Considering the time spans we are working with, some evidence of gremlins' presence on Cradle had to be established from the very beginning of Clockworks construction, so the Great Colony must be one of the oldest developments.

We propose, that the name itself here suggests that the Great Colony is a literal colony, a colonial domain on a distant planet - that of Cradle, - meaning, that there exists a gremlin interstellar empire with a remote metropole, to which Great Colony had to belong, rather than a civilization relegated to single planet of Cradle.

As Great Colony is one of more significant locations of gremlin civilization on Cradle, and considering how ancient are Clockworks themselves, even taking in account that gremlins were implied to be assisted in its construction - `Some say the gremlins that you see working on it now are responsable. But that seems too great even for their seemingly infinite work force` (<a href="https://wiki.spiralknights.com/Plinkop#Dialogue" target="_blank">Plinkop</a>), and `if we are to believe that indeed a lost kingdom from the past has somehow wound up in a massive mechanical world in present day, the question remains, why? its all a bit too convenient. But do gremlins really have this kind of power? I suspect something more than even what they are capable of engineering` (<a href="https://wiki.spiralknights.com/Eye_of_the_Needle" target="_blank">Eye of the Needle - Kora</a>), - Clockworks should have been present at least by the time Iron Hulk was haunted.

Of course, there exists a possibility of Clockworks existing for thousands of years, which does seem more plausible, as then Strangers of Haven would not have any modern recounts of Clockworks beginnings: `"How old are the Clockworks?" - It is hard to know exactly as so much of what is within seems to hold their origin from different worlds. Some appear to be from realms of great antiquity, no doubt once home to innumerable old gods and creatures. This world is an unnatural one. What you see within it was never meant to be here. The great histories of so many worlds endlessly churning through the cogs of this great machine` (<a href="https://wiki.spiralknights.com/Plinkop#Dialogue" target="_blank">Plinkop</a>). That is, if their responses are taken at face value, and with an assumption that Clockworks had not appeared in a few hundred years, even with an assistance of currently unknowns third party, as Plinkop's and Kora's dialogues suggest.

We could analyze the location of Great Colony in the same manner, as we had attempted to understand what purpose dry docks serve and the architecture of Owlite Academy. But here, it is not the location itself is important, but rather an understanding of what had happened before current hierarchy of clans was established.

Considering the scale of Clockworks, as they comprise most likely most of all known volume of the planet, we assume, that some foundation for their construction, the raw materials, had to be gathered somewhere - be it a different planets or the one from which initially the construction began. In the first case, we can appeal to the idea of many worlds being literally gathered, put together as Cradle, which may place Great Colony as the very first location of gremlin settlement, designed for, potentially environment of vacuum. The second case can lead to Great Colony being also the first settlement, but within an environment of a regular planet, that was harvested to build Clockworks.

While those explanations have speculative foundation based on the lack of any information, they remove a dependency on an undisclosed planet, and at least, weave it into the general narrative, as the prior had to be incorporated into Cradle either way at some point in time under current chronology. This planet had to contain most of the entities from the timeline: dragons, Owlites, Kats, Almire. These include later discoveries of the Nameless Realm and Underworld. This proposal, then, would not conflict with epochs of kingdom of Almire. Despite a possibility of decoupling Almire's narrative and history from the rest, mainly from the origins of legion of Ur and the relation to heavenly kingdom of valkyries, mentioned forgotten time, it would not bring drastic changes to the timeline, as currently all of the Underworld-adjacent laws are not restricted by presence of the Core, apart from spirits returning to material realm.

#### Gremlin Physiology

As for gremlins, while the location of Great Colony remains unknown, we still can attempt to guess, what it was before any large-scale construction of Clockworks had begun:

- Considering gremlins of all known clans, - Tenderfoot, Ironclaw, Darkfang, and Grinchlins, - wear goggles, including those located in Emberlight, we can suggests that underground conditions had taken effect on gremlin physiology. Gremlins of Haven, such as Pakrat, Punch, and Vise, still wear similar uniform and have obscured muzzle with goggles or masks reminiscent of Strangers' design.

  There is a case of Crimson Order member, Seerus, as he lacks any explicitly advanced equipment, preferring a mask over goggles, through which his spiral eyes are seen. This, with ths general motif of Seerus being described as: `Taking on ol' Seerus aye? Careful now, he's not right in the head. Proper imbalanced that one. He and I go way back, but not in any way worth remembering` (<a href="https://wiki.spiralknights.com/Vise" target="_blank">Operation Crimson Hammer - Lobby - Vise</a>), seems as a design decision, rather than his status as a member of the Order.

- Presence of Sun and Moon plates within Clockworks' artificial sky of skydomes. The moon is identical to one on Cradle's orbit, as both have a characteristic spiral on the near side.

  The fact those are located within Clockwork skydomes does suggest that those locations are built to house biospheres, when compared to regular Clockwork tunnels. But, apart from budget restrictions of the game, why would both celestial bodies had to be presented as ones of Cradle's star system, with all of the moving machinery accompanying it?

  It is also within those skydomes gremlin facilities - the compounds, - are present on par with other stratums in archaeological sense, such as tortomega ruins across Aurora Isles in their different forms.

Based on those elements we can suggest that gremlins, as a specie, had to be either nocturnal or inhabiting planetary surface under natural conditions. A question can be posed - gremlins could be originally cave-dwelling species, but then, presence of fur makes it an uncommon characteristic of such specie. It is also presence of a day-night cycle within the skydomes which would point to more natural conditions in the past, be it Cradle, a different planet, or gremlin homeworld.

#### Gremlin Military-Industrial Complex

As compounds were considered as a form of lesser gremlin facilities within skydomes, we have to address the more general notions, inspirations, and motifs of modern-day gremlin civilization.

Throughout rank missions and the Arcade gates several gremlin facilities are encountered, those are compounds, located within biospheres of skydomes, and rank-mission exclusive underground complexes. The latter, specifically Camp Crimson and complex 357, as well as the Grand Arsenal, share same security measures, such as barbed wire, anti-tank concrete blocks, likely serving same purpose as dragon's teeth, and anti-tank hedgehogs.

Apart from those structure there are production centers and research facilities, from which Ironclaw Munitions Factory and compound 42 stand out as most prominent, but not the only ones.

Based on this information we have at least 2 types of numbered facilities - compounds and complexes. Their ownership strategy remains vague, which will be analyzed further.

##### Mecha Knight Factories

One of more characteristic elements of gremlins was their skillful creation of constructs, such as battlepods, mecha knights, and lastly gun puppies. We will return to gun puppies motif later, as they were already present as creations of tortomega but now we will focus on mecha knights.

One of such factories is found during <a href="https://wiki.spiralknights.com/Toy_Soldiers" target="_blank">Toy Soldiers mission</a>: `Recon Knights ... have discovered a mecha knight production facility close to Haven. Mecha Knights are believed to be gremlin-engineered sentries of the construct family that share many of the capabilities of a Spiral Knight`. This factory, as suggested by the layout of <a href="https://wiki.spiralknights.com/Toy_Soldiers#Gate_Map" target="_blank">Factory Floor</a>, is located within Clockwork service tunnels outside of skydomes. Deeper into the factory the <a href="https://wiki.spiralknights.com/Toy_Soldiers/Production_Center" target="_blank">Production Center</a> itself is located.

The production center is controlled by the battlepod surrounded by a hexagonal shield. Since this pattern of a shield is present only on battlepods, we can conclude that it is a gremlin invention.

##### Heavy Weapons Facility: Sparkcaster and Sputterspark

The Heavy Weapons Facility is found during <a href="https://wiki.spiralknights.com/Shocking_Sentient_Sentries" target="_blank">Shocking Sentinel Sentries mission</a> and is described as: `a secret weapons facility that according to the intel ..., could belong to a high ranking gremlin of The Crimson Order. It is heavily fortified by a small army of electrified constructs ... While it is unclear if this weapons stash actually belongs to a gremlin of The Crimson Order, it is no less worth infiltrating and neutralizing the weapons stash` (<a href="https://wiki.spiralknights.com/Shocking_Sentient_Sentries" target="_blank">Shocking Sentinel Sentries</a>). The fact of its belonging is later confirmed by the dialogue between <a href="https://wiki.spiralknights.com/Sputterspark" target="_blank">Sputterspark</a> - an engineer, and warmaster Seerus of Crimson Order, within the final floor of the facility: `The Sparkcaster Deluxe is almost stable, I promise. I need a little more time, Warmaster. ... It looks like time has run out, Sputterspark. You'd better hope your little toy works` (<a href="https://wiki.spiralknights.com/Shocking_Sentient_Sentries/Heavy_Weapons_Facility" target="_blank">Sputterspark and Seerus</a>).

The facility itself houses a stationary device Sparkcaster, whose purpose, judging by the second encounter during <a href="https://wiki.spiralknights.com/The_Great_Escape" target="_blank">Great Escape</a> in the prison <a href="https://wiki.spiralknights.com/The_Great_Escape/The_Yard" target="_blank">yard</a>, is to hinder enemy movement on the frontlines by remote generation of artificial lightning from the rear.

Considering that the facility is marked as secret, it is plausible that Sparkcaster is of the same purpose as compound 42 of Herex of Crimson Order: `Production of Compound 42 is to cease immediately. While a formidable poison and no doubt useful in achieving a... 'higher' power amongst the Order, it seems to have formed an intelligence well beyond the scope of a standard bio-toxin` (<a href="https://wiki.spiralknights.com/Compound_42/Containment" target="_blank">Compound 42 - Containment</a>), - that of Crimson Order member's secret research facility.

The second iteration of the device is labelled as Sparkcaster 9000 Deluxe. Considering that it is stated as a triumph in gremlin engineering, we may read it in 2 ways: a comical hyperbole for the narrative as an actual analysis of the device with all of known laws of physic in mind.

As we are analyzing and connecting everything, we will go with the latter option. Specifically, the sole act of the device casting relatively controlled lightning is deeply related to the principles underlying Clockwork Power Complexes. We will return to Sparkcaster in that section later.

##### Test Labs

One of testing laboratories was found to contain schematics for Roarmulus Twins, or at that point in time, known only as Project R during the events of <a href="https://wiki.spiralknights.com/Plan_of_Attack" target="_blank">Plan of Attack</a>: `Deep within a toxic cavern lies a hidden test lab that gremlins have been using as a testing ground for components of Project R. One of these components still in development is reported to have schematics for the project close by` (<a href="https://wiki.spiralknights.com/Plan_of_Attack" target="_blank">Plan of Attack</a>).

##### Weapon Caches, Factories, and Munition Storages

Mission <a href="https://wiki.spiralknights.com/Sewer_Stash" target="_blank">Sewer Stash</a> establishes existence of weapon caches across Clockworks: `Intel suggests that once manufactured, weapons are moved out of the Ironclaw Munitions Factory and stored in secret weapon caches throughout the Clockworks. One of these caches has been uncovered in one of the Clockwork's wasteworks systems` (<a href="https://wiki.spiralknights.com/Sewer_Stash" target="_blank">Sewer Stash</a>). That weapon cache contains instances of battlepods.

A decommissioned type of similar munitions storages and factories is explored through <a href="https://wiki.spiralknights.com/Assault_on_Machine_Shop_13" target="_blank">Assault on Machine Shop 13</a> mission - `decommissioned gremlin weapons factories that are still actively bustling with hostile constructs, and in some cases are even stocked with operational, active war machines`, proving presence of factories across varying terrain.

##### Crimson Order Hideouts

Established during the event of <a href="https://wiki.spiralknights.com/Spark_and_Roar" target="_blank">Spark and Roar</a>: `An exceptionally high concentration of constructs has been found guarding an area of the Clockworks that Spiral HQ suspects could be a Crimson Order hideout`. A <a href="https://wiki.spiralknights.com/Spark_and_Roar/Hidden_Hideout" target="_blank">Hidden Hideout</a> presents itself as one belonging to Herex, but the ownership and its state are not important currently. It is its size and location. Before actual arena knights had to traverse a march and Iron Tundra, while the latter is a deconstruction zone, we have to consider general theme of being a small hideout of a member of Crimson Order deep in the frozen location. The arena depth might suggest it being a security measure for the hideout itself, which, while hidden in cold of what can be considered a taiga, might suggest it being a personal quarters, for example, in case of severe emergency. And judging by the contents of the hideout, emergency it was. indeed.

The <a href="https://wiki.spiralknights.com/File:Hidden_Hideout.jpg" target="_blank">size</a> of the hideout is also of interest to us, as it isn't large, containing only a few points of interest:

- A yard with a Crimson Order insignia.
- Workstation with vials and information module
- Entrance and exit elevators connected to the system of Clockwork gates.

Another point of interest are the cisterns and the main structural body behind the exit elevator. The location's design itself resembles gremlin town of <a href="https://wiki.spiralknights.com/Emberlight" target="_blank">Emberlight</a>, that is the hull is habitable and likely contains proper living quarters, which would suffice a few gremlins for a limited time as it is first and foremost a hideout. Potentially a bunker, even, considering the metal beam extending upwards, suggesting a reinforced structure.

##### Compound 42 and Slime Generators

As for the rest of military research facilities, there is compound 42, which specializes in production of bioweapons. It is described as: `a gremlin bioweapons facility deep within the Clockworks. It is believed that this facility belongs to a member of the Crimson Order known only as Herex. The Recon Rangers have been tasked with infiltrating the facility and uncovering the nature of Herex's bioweapons before they are put to use`.

When it is infiltrated, it is discovered that Herex had already ordered to burn it, removing all of evidence of its existence: `Production of Compound 42 is to cease immediately. While a formidable poison and no doubt useful in achieving a... 'higher' power amongst the Order, it seems to have formed an intelligence well beyond the scope of a standard bio-toxin. All traces of Compound 42 should be eliminated, along with the facility and any engineers not part of the inner fold. Remind the scorchers who find these orders uncomfortable that those who disobey shall soon hear my whisper in their ears. Seal the doors and burn everything to the ground` (<a href="https://wiki.spiralknights.com/Compound_42/Containment" target="_blank">Compound 42 - Containment - Secret Memo - Herex</a>). The poison with intelligence of standard bio-toxin question are the <a href="https://wiki.spiralknights.com/Toxoil" target="_blank">toxoils</a>.

The facility contains large storage tubes of green gel. Based on the quote `it seems to have formed an intelligence well beyond the scope of a standard bio-toxin` (<a href="https://wiki.spiralknights.com/Compound_42/Containment" target="_blank">Compound 42 - Containment - Secret Memo - Herex</a>), we can make a working assumption that this gel content is the bio-toxin. But, this puts in question a natural origin of <a href="https://wiki.spiralknights.com/Toxigel#Toxoil" target="_blank">toxoilers</a> and <a href="https://wiki.spiralknights.com/Toxigel#Toxigel" target="_blank">toxigels</a>. Regular <a href="https://wiki.spiralknights.com/Toxigel#Toxigel" target="_blank">toxigels</a> and then oilers are both also found across locations, which does not seem to be connected to the compound.

At the last arena of the <a href="https://wiki.spiralknights.com/Compound_42/Containment" target="_blank">containment</a> 6 large tubes of orange gel are found in the end of the structure, several of which are seen to be leaking. We suggest those are the basis for oilers in order to produce what became toxoils. There are also 3 large leaking tubes of green gel on the west side of the structure, toxic gel, comprising toxigels.

During the event of <a href="https://wiki.spiralknights.com/The_Vile_Engine" target="_blank">Vile Engine</a> mission lichens were also involved: `Somewhere below a level that lichens have taken to inhabiting lies a strange facility of unknown origin that seems to be used for the production of toxic slime monsters. The 'slime generators' are capable of rapidly producing slime monsters that then quickly populate nearby levels. Squads in neighboring levels have already reported overwhelming numbers of toxic slimes, making it impossible to lead expeditions beyond depth 23. It is time ... to infiltrate this strange facility and shut down production of these vile creatures. Any data that you could collect as their origin would be highly valuable to Spiral HQ` (<a href="https://wiki.spiralknights.com/The_Vile_Engine" target="_blank">Vile Engine</a>). The generators are presented in the <a href="https://wiki.spiralknights.com/The_Vile_Engine/Processing_Plant" target="_blank">Processing Plant</a> as 2 battlepods creating not toxic, but <a href="https://wiki.spiralknights.com/Quicksilver" target="_blank">quicksilver</a> lichens.

Considering past knowledge of Herex specializing in bioweapons, involving accidental creation or mutation of lichens in compound 42, an assumption could be made that this facility does also relate to Herex. Yet, this inconsistency of the <a href="https://wiki.spiralknights.com/The_Vile_Engine/Processing_Plant" target="_blank">processing plant</a> itself will be kept in mind for the analysis of quicksilver lichens.

##### Camp Crimson and Prisons

Depth of <a href="https://wiki.spiralknights.com/The_Collector/Camp_Crimson" target="_blank">Camp Crimson</a> is one of 2 known facilities of a distinct design. While Camp Crimson is not seen from the outside, the other location, complex 357 is.

The camp, within a proximity of an entrance, contains what seems to be rail tracks for the transportation vessels, resembling armored trains. Those vessels are armed with an artillery canons on the their roofs and contain barred cells within the hull. The same cells are observed all across the camp, with a few placed within the metal scaffolding-like structures above and below the depth of a camp. The rails themselves are also found leading up and into the fortified perimeter of <a href="https://wiki.spiralknights.com/Grand_Arsenal" target="_blank">Grand Arsenal</a>, and seen multiple times within the arsenal.

Entirety of the camp's site is structured as a highly secured location, with search lights, armored watchtowers, and barbed wire. Apart from those, a peculiar element of metal pillars is seen across the camp, explicitly noticeable near the exit elevator, with rows of pillars extending upwards, with widespread usage of Crimson Order insignia. All of those designs are present both across Camp Crimson and later discussed complex 357.

It is unknown weather camps as such had operated solely as prisons, or were of worse purpose. Yet, as knights had arrived relatively recently, we can suggest that those structures were built within the context of clan and Crimson Order members' inner conflicts.

As for the Spiral Order, there are events of <a href="https://wiki.spiralknights.com/The_Great_Escape" target="_blank">Great Escape</a>: `Recon Knights have collected intel that has revealed the gremlin 'Crimson Order' has begun ordering gremlins to build makeshift prisons within the Clockworks where Spiral Knights are being taken and imprisoned. It is believed that these orders are coming in direct response to your destruction of the Roarmulus Twins. Further data suggests that these makeshift prisons are a temporary solution until a larger facility can be built. Spiral HQ however has no intention of these imprisoned knights staying long enough to find out`. The fact that this solution is suggested to be a temporary one, we can guess that the earlier question of Camp Crimson purpose may potentially be of the latter.

##### Complex 357

Encountered at the end of <a href="https://wiki.spiralknights.com/Crimson_Chaos" target="_blank">Crimson Chaos</a>, <a href="https://wiki.spiralknights.com/Crimson_Chaos/Complex_357" target="_blank">Complex 357</a> is a highly guarded facility, and the only one across rank missions, whose surface entrance is seen. While located within a compound area of skydome, the main facility is very distinct by its design, most reminiscent of an imperial style:

- Its inner yard has a wide inclined ascent to the entrance.
- To the sides of the main road, patches of grass with trees, and, more importantly, gun puppy statues, as ones found across the grounds of tortomega civilization are found.
- Crimson order tapestry is seen on the armor plated of the front facility.
- Largest to date amount of battlepods at the entrance, albeit already destroyed.
- As in Camp Crimson, there are hanging tapestries of Crimson Order insignia.

The complex itself is described in the <a href="https://wiki.spiralknights.com/Crimson_Chaos" target="_blank">Crimson Chaos</a> mission as follows: `Spiral HQ has been monitoring several known Crimson Order bases in hopes of intercepting one of their elusive high-ranking members. Recon knights assigned to watch one of those bases report that it has suddenly gone silent and have requested backup before investigating it further`. The gate icon of the inner facility, the underground complex itself, is the same image of a rocket utilized to mark depths related to the Ironclaw Munitions Factory. The Recon soldier and the entrance to the complex reports: `We've been monitoring the base for weeks then it went silent. Quite suddenly. We're not sure what you're going to find down there. Our sensors show no active life forms`.

The contents of the facility were crucial enough for Herex to infiltrate it, as suggested by general state it is found as well as the information module belonging to Herex: `Infiltrate the Complex. Take all schematics. The Nine are quite but we will silence them. The Knights persue but we will halt them. Only Herex comprehends the Truth. Only Herex will descend. There can be no other` (<a href="https://wiki.spiralknights.com/Complex_357" target="_blank">Crimson Chaos - Complex 357 - Herex</a>). There are valuable schematics which were the goal of infiltration. At that point we do not know the purpose of those. The facility itself contains only poison-themed constructs, alluding to Herex's themes. But it is a matter of discussion, weather the facility belongs to Herex. This is due to the fact Knight hadn't discovered any activity or large-scale invasion, which makes it seem to us in 2 ways:

- The facility had already contained poison-themes constructs.
- A different entrance was used to transport the army.

Judging by the general theming as well as the fact Herex is seen to do his operations by his own (`Remind the scorchers who find these orders uncomfortable that those who disobey shall soon hear my whisper in their ears. Seal the doors and burn everything to the ground` - [Compound 42 - Containment - Secret Memo: Herex](https://wiki.spiralknights.com/Containment)) and several gremlin Stalkers, we lean to a narrative wherein him and a few Stalkers had infiltrated the complex unnoticed. The matter of facility's ownership here then seemingly concludes on being of Herex's. And it is in the main entrance after the bridge 2 poison-themed gun puppies are seen at respawn pads behind the barricade.

But a counterpoint can be introduced here, it is during the events of Shadowplay Herex had arrived with an army of poison-themed constructs and gremlins to the location of the Mysterious Console behind the Throne Room of Firestorm Citadel.

We can analyze the facility itself, as compared to Camp Crimson, it is seen in already damaged state:

- The central entrance of 9 tiles width to the first gatehouse surrounded by 2 armored watchtowers and accompanied by metal pillars, is severely damaged. The part of the bridge is torn off, and the part leading up the the gates has signs of bombardment or other force to cause elongated cracks on the bridge.

  This level of damage could not be likely done by sole action sof Herex and Stalkers.

- The facility is filled with mineral rocks, which seem to hinder the movement deeper into the complex.

Apart the above elements several rooms seem to contain the desired schematics:

- East of the first gates there is a room with a gold key, secured by 5 gate-button pairs. It has a single rocket launcher - <a href="https://wiki.spiralknights.com/File:Exploration-Gun_Block.png" target="_blank">gun blocks</a>, 1 dead gremlin and multiple torn pages on the floor, 2 clips, and multiple monitors
- West of the first gates a room before a puzzle contains 2 cisterns, purple and green tubes of gel, monitors, a few smaller vials, 1 clip and a gremlin with also many torn pages on the floor surrounding it. Notably, at the thin entrance to the room, west of it a pool of gel and valestone is seen pumped out of the smaller pipe. Norse of the most-west section with rocket launchers a single tube of green liquid is locate. A few grinded luminite minerals are found below it.
- The final room is located north of the complex, beyond the battlepod. There are also torn pages, several monitors, 2 clips, notable, several large books - as one opened and a few tomes, and a dead gremlin. Judging by that, it seems that the infiltration was sudden, and has happened while the facility had operated normally.

Due to those factor, as well as Herex's seeming disregard for personnel during the events of compound 42 annihilation, this complex seems to belong to Herex. The constructs present there then could the ones used by him in the Throne Room, as they had to be built at someone's production center, if taken in account facilities discussed in [Mecha knight Factories section](#mecha-knight-factories). The "inner fold" mentioned in the secret memo of Compound 42 seem to suggest it being those Stalkers (`All traces of Compound 42 should be eliminated, along with the facility and any engineers not part of the inner fold` - [Compound 42 - Containment - Secret Memo: Herex](https://wiki.spiralknights.com/Containment)) as well a few gremlins fought in the <a href="https://wiki.spiralknights.com/Shadowplay" target="_blank">Throne Room</a> of <a href="https://wiki.spiralknights.com/Shadowplay" target="_blank">Shadowplay</a>.

##### Cradle Defenses

Cradle weapons are encountered directly during intro cinematic, as were used on Skylark as well as potentially mentioned by Parma in the Refuge: `Once, the gremlins were in charge of maintaining Cradle's defenses. But they had their own plans` (<a href="https://wiki.spiralknights.com/Refuge" target="_blank">Dreams and Nightmares - Refuge - Parma's Scout</a>).

Judging by the footage, the beams had originated from the exposed Clockwork segments from 3 sources. The beams themselves are most reminiscent of lasers utilized by the battlepods of Grand Arsenal and Big Iron, as well as incorporated into Roarmulus Twins. A key difference here is the fact those lasers are purple. It can be explained by an application of shadow damage, which seems as both most plausible and single explanation.

Usage of shadow damage is not novel for gremlins, as they did utilize it, although in lesser amounts, mostly attributed to the members of Crimson Order, such as Seerus and his devices bombs - <a href="https://wiki.spiralknights.com/Dark_Retribution" target="_blank">Dark Retribution</a> alchemy tree: `The perfected version of the shadowy bomb that Warmaster Seerus engineered with the sole purpose of eliminating other gremlins that stood in his way. It is thought to have been reserved for use against other members of the Crimson Order` (<a href="https://wiki.spiralknights.com/Dark_Retribution" target="_blank">Dark Retribution</a>). So the usage of it for the planetary defenses seems as likely explanation, considering that shadow damage is known to be dangerous both to gremlins and lichens.

##### The Collector

The Collector is described as follows: `There have been reports of a large, mechanical entity we have named the 'Collector' who has been intercepting our knights and taking both them and the sprites they were tracking and imprisoning them in a well-guarded compound deep within the Clockworks. Armed with your new sprite, your mission is to find this 'Collector' and rescue the knights and the sprites it has taken captive` (<a href="https://wiki.spiralknights.com/The_Collector" target="_blank">The Collector</a>).

Based on the analysis of Camp Crimson we came to conclusion, that the camp itself was established prior to arrival of Spiral Order, and, due to ability to capture Knights and Sprites by the Collector, we propose that its previous function was to capture gremlins.

Apart from this, it is likely that it had also served as an elite unit across constructs such as mecha knights by the fact of having similar design of wrenches in place of limbs and great offensive capabilities.

One of greater importance elements of its arsenal is the large charged explosion. This is the key element to a larger motif which will be then analyzed across gremlin technology. The explosion in both instances of the Collector - within the camp and at the <a href="https://wiki.spiralknights.com/Breaking_in_the_Recruits/The_Overworks" target="_blank">Overworks</a>, - deals split shadow and normal damage, its only shadow damaging attack. Moreover, the explosion has an antique evil eye to appear, the same observed across Electron and Graviton bombs design. Considering this, a white painted evil eye of the same antique design with the Collector's eye meant to be an iris seems as an intentional design choice, which also points to its explosive shadow damage attack.

Apart from it, a different relation to curse arises here. Lord Vanaduke, when he has no mask, has red and orange arcs of lightning around him. Those lightnings are the same as the collector. Moreover, Arkus also in his later stages of the fight has lightning arcs present in the same pattern, although of purple color, same as Darkfire Vanaduke unmasked. We suggest that this is a clear design pattern. If it would not be for the evil eye, this would not be a reason for an analysis of the latter that early. But, as the theme of curse in its different forms is consistent here, we propose that it serves as an argument for the collector being constructed utilizing far more advanced technology, involving Underworld and whatever is the power symbolized by the dread seal.

##### Electron Vortex

Electron vortex is an elemental counterpart of the Graviton bomb, but both have the same animation and presence of an antique evil eye of the same shape as the Collector. The case of the Collector - due to its explosion's design, we propose, is of the same nature as more likely electron bomb and less likely graviton bomb, yet, tapping into the powers of curse and Underworld.

But, due to descriptions of those bombs we believe they were invented in different period of time:

- `A small explosive charge with mysterious origins. It is capable of generating a vortex of crushing gravity` (<a href="https://wiki.spiralknights.com/Graviton_Charge" target="_blank">Graviton Charge</a>).
- `A Graviton Bomb fortified with potentially dangerous amounts of shadow steel. Its blast should draw your foes toward it... if it doesn't rip the entire universe in two, that is` (<a href="https://wiki.spiralknights.com/Graviton_Vortex" target="_blank">Graviton Vortex</a>).
- `A small electro-explosive charge with mysterious origins. It is capable of generating a crippling vortex of electricity` (<a href="https://wiki.spiralknights.com/Electron_Charge" target="_blank">Electron Charge</a>).
- `Adapted from several unconventional Gremlin theories on physics, anyone unlucky enough to be dragged into this bomb's blast is in for a shock` (<a href="https://wiki.spiralknights.com/Electron_Bomb" target="_blank">Electron Bomb</a>).
- `An Electron Bomb modified with a payload of unstable organic essence. Foes caught in its punishing radius are cruelly referred to as "thunderstuck"` (<a href="https://wiki.spiralknights.com/Electron_Vortex" target="_blank">Electron Vortex</a>). As it is stated to be `modified with a payload of unstable organic essence`, and by the fact of being a 5-star equipment, it has 1 additional material to its recipe - <a href="https://wiki.spiralknights.com/Storm_Chaser" target="_blank">Storm Chaser</a>: `A rare elemental found hovering in storm clouds. Their electric hum creates an almost melodic choir that can be faintly heard between thunderclaps`, which seems to us as direct confirmation of the elemental being used in the transmutation process.

We propose an explanation. That is gremlins have invented <a href="https://wiki.spiralknights.com/Electron_Vortex" target="_blank">Electron Vortex</a> based of the <a href="https://wiki.spiralknights.com/Graviton_Bomb" target="_blank">Graviton Bomb</a> through introduction of their own tech, specifically related to electricity and shock, such as Storm Chasers, as it is present in the recipe. As it is an elemental counterpart to Graviton Bomb, the reason for devilish material - <a href="https://wiki.spiralknights.com/Forbidden_Fruit" target="_blank">Forbidden Fruit</a> specifically, had to be justified, which here, we suggest, is a common underlying motif. It can be argued that <a href="https://wiki.spiralknights.com/Forbidden_Fruit" target="_blank">Forbidden Fruit</a> is also used transmute <a href="https://wiki.spiralknights.com/Twisted_Spine_Cone" target="_blank">Twisted Spine Cone</a>, but we have to remember that Snarbolax, whom this item is attributed, is related to curse and then Underworld.

##### Gremlin Incinerators

Multiple <a href="https://wiki.spiralknights.com/Gremlin_Incinerator#Gremlin_Incinerator" target="_blank">Gremlins incinerators</a> are found in the end of compound 42 have a unique design. Not only they are as large as Razwog, their masks seem to suggest a similar inspiration. Those masks differ from regular wielding masks by the fact of being less of a visor and more of an eye. Notably, the plate this red eye is located on, also is capable of moving across the height of helm's surface as it has a slot underneath, similar to collector's head design. Considering those scorchers are an elite units implied to be under a command of Herex of Crimson Order, we can make an educated guess that the collector's design in the context of gremlin elite units is more common than it seems.

##### Grand Arsenal

One of a few elements worth mentioning within the Grand Arsenal are the railways extending from the frontiers of of the complex. While no transportation carts were seen across the operation, we can suggest at least 2 uses for them:

- as there are several holding cells within the facility, it can be argued that those were transported across the rails, but, their number is abysmal compared to the construction of Camp Crimson.
- A more likely explanation is those railways are designed to deliver ammunition from the complex. Grand Arsenal is the only place apart from Razwog's facility above power complex, wherein <a href="https://wiki.spiralknights.com/File:Exploration-Unused_Rocket.png" target="_blank">unused rockets</a> with gremlin symbol are visibly used.

Then there are what seems to be conveyors for missiles found below the Grand Arsenal artillery - 2 lines of missiles extending from the chambers protected with red force fields. Those 2 lines then, passing through a wall of the facility end with vertical launching systems, as evident by both the metal beams and how those rockets react to being damaged - by launching upwards. Since it is essentially a fortified arsenal storage facility, we can gather that it is not the production lines, but only of delivery and transportation.

##### Crimson Throne and Aftermath

The other point of interest is located at the end of Grand Arsenal, in the innermost location only labeled as "Aftermath" during the operation. It is accessed from behind the wall of the main entrance of the Arsenal, wherein the arsenal itself is found, with Crimson Order tapestry hanging above. This part of facility is seeming the only one with visible walls extending above the ground level, resembling lobbies of danger missions.

The location of Aftermath is the main briefing room of the facility, as due to its unique execution with Crimson Order throne present at its center surrounded by hulls of inactive Roarmulus Twins. Apart from the throne, there are 3 distinct areas, sides of the throne 6 monitors are present, which seem to contain the most important for Spiral Order data. One of the soldiers accompanying Feron comments on the gremlin cryptography: `` (). We will revisit it later. The other area is located south of the throne, it is the one seen first, it also contains several non-interactive computers.

By the sides of the throne room, there are 2 lines of storage, containing inactive and damaged Roarmulus Twins and battlepods. Weather those are manufactured within the facility is unknown, but, as suggested by presence of the Ironclaw Munitions Factory, it seems that the latter is responsible for the production, while Arsenal is mostly utilized for storage. The only ill-fit element in this interpretation are the 2 production lines found below the artillery, as the design it too distinct to be unintentional.

#### Ironclaw Munitions Factory

Ironclaw Munitions Factory presents a few novel concepts as well as reaffirms several previous ones. First we must note on the scope of the analysis of the factory - we consider Shadow Ironclaw Munitions factory, currently, at least, from the point of layout and its contents, - that both shock-themed and fire-themed factory is canon. With that in mind we will go through both of them starting from the regular variant.

The factory is described as follows:

- `The Ironclaw Munitions Factory is a gremlin-operated weapons factory that specializes in the production of high-calibur explosives. Intel has revealed that it is developing a secret weapon known as 'Project Roarmulus' designed with the sole purpose of destroying Haven!` (<a href="https://wiki.spiralknights.com/Ironclaw_Munitions_Factory" target="_blank">Ironclaw Munitions Factory</a>).
- `Once known to Spiral HQ as 'Project R', the Roarmulus Twins have been identified as a gremlin-engineered weapon of tremendous power built with the sole purpose of destroying Haven. Stored deep within the heart of the Ironclaw Munitions Factory, this weapon is not only protected by hordes of shock-powered constructs and gremlins, but the factory is a highly dangerous, explosive hazard itself!` ([Built to Destroy!](https://wiki.spiralknights.com/Built_to_Destroy!)).
- `After analyzing the schematics you recovered from the gremlin test lab, Spiral HQ know knows the nature of Project R as well as its location within a gremlin munitions facility. Spiral HQ is requesting that you enter this facility and destroy Project R before it can be used on Haven. Speak with Intel Agent Kora for full details` (<a href="https://wiki.spiralknights.com/Target_Acquired" target="_blank">Target Acquired</a>).
- `Project R appears to be in fact two massive weapons known as the 'Roarmulus Twins.' ... Designed by one of the Crimson Order itself, the Roarmulus Twins are some kind of construct cannon that the gremlins intend on moving up the Clockworks into the Haven Arcade! ... Based on what the schematics suggest, their power far exceeds standard gremlin weaponry and could be truly devastating to Haven, Spiral HQ and the strangers should it reach the Arcade. ... We have pinpointed its location to be in the deepest level of a gremlin facility known as the 'Ironclaw Munitions Factory.' The factory is used for the production of all manners of gremlin weaponry and is highly dangerous, even to the gremlins working there. ... There's one last thing- it seems you won't be the first knight to have entered the Ironclaw Munitions Factory. We've detected another Alpha Squad recon module somewhere within the factory` (<a href="https://wiki.spiralknights.com/Target_Acquired" target="_blank">Target Acquired - Kora</a>).

Based on the earlier analysis we had concluded that th factory itself is at least hundred years old due to presence of laser technology, its research and development. The deteriorated state of the <a href="https://wiki.spiralknights.com/Abandoned_Assembly" target="_blank">abandoned assembly</a> and due to its name we can draw parallels with the state complex 357 is found in as well as its gate icon.

Entrance to the factory, same as complex 357, is also particularly distinct. The entrance is a wide road - 11 tiles, with an entrance of 4 tiles. Around the entrance road there are 6 structure support beams or pillars with the foundation of Clockworks' design. Several roads leading up to the entrance apart from the elevator are blown off, with significant structural damage to the road itself.

Once inside the walls the factory separates into 2 wings, both of which contain several instances of Project R components, all of which were depicted on the <a href="https://wiki.spiralknights.com/Roarmulus_Blueprints" target="_blank">Roarmulus Blueprints</a>. Apart from it several deign choices are seem in the eastern wing which seem to suggest those being conveyor belts.

Within the Warfare Workshop another feature of the factory becomes more consistent, which was also present on previous depth - pools of <a href="https://wiki.spiralknights.com/Lichen#Quicksilver" target="_blank">quicksilver</a> slime. Those are reminiscent of previously discussed compound 42's likely artificially created <a href="https://wiki.spiralknights.com/Lichen#Toxoil" target="_blank">toxoils</a>.

As for Workshop's layout, it has a central hall, separated from the machinery on the sides with walls, and during infiltration it is notable that western wing was not visited, although the path their remains intact. But it is the left wing which allows to understand approximate size of the facility, with the same design of 3 spaciously places support pillars as those found near the entrance hall of the facility, and eastern wall being a support or scaffolding structure. It is also in the western wing an internal components of the Roarmulus twin are seen. In the end of the facility's floor and to the west testing grounds for laser cannons are present.

In the final depth of the facility, which is also described as its deepest point (`Stored deep within the heart of the Ironclaw Munitions Factory` - [Built to Destroy!](https://wiki.spiralknights.com/Built_to_Destroy!)) the same large structure beams are consistently placed in relatively large amount, as in previously discussed Herex's <a href="https://wiki.spiralknights.com/Hidden_Hideout" target="_blank">hideout</a>. We believe, those serve the same purpose - as they are present in the deepest points of both locations, they also mark it as, seemingly, most secure, as conveyed by the design choice of those beams being placed.

If the entire plot of Project R is taken in consideration with the context of the factory being at that level of maintenance, we can make a guess that the gremlin society is long past its prime.

Now, there are not many elemental gremlin weapons in a sense closer to Owlites, as they had directly utilized elemental powers, relating back to the discussion of Owlite academy and Valkyrian armors. Considering 2 following aspects:

- Shadow Ironclaw Munitions Factory only recently started to produce fire-themed weapons, and by the far more hazardous design of Red Roarmulus Twins, the elemental direction is less developed
- Shadow weapons on the other hand are kept to upper echelons of gremlin society - such as Dark Retribution, as supposedly lasers. Yet, those devices are seem to be more consistent in their design. Presence of shadow elements and Underworld's symbology while is subtle, but consistent with the rest of technology.

We can make an educated guess that Cradle's defenses did consist of the same laser technology found in the factory, but, due to subtle coloring, also imbued with shadows.

Yet, it is through the analysis of the events preceding the infiltration of the factory we can discover the scope of gremlin technology and advancements which we see as thematically consistent with the earlier case of laser technology acknowledging multitude of other motifs and preestablished laws of physics across Cradle.

- `Deep within a toxic cavern lies a hidden test lab that gremlins have been using as a testing ground for components of Project R. One of these components still in development is reported to have schematics for the project close by. If this is true there will likely be a terminal of some kind close to one of Project R's components. Locate the terminal and recover the schematics for analysis. It should shed light on the exact nature of Project R` (<a href="https://wiki.spiralknights.com/Plan_of_Attack" target="_blank">Plan of Attack</a>).

  Power grid is hidden within the toxic cavern and contains a hull of an inactive Roarmulus Twin. The power complex itself, in its purpose is reminiscent of Razwog's facility, as in both cases the centerpoint is the power cords leading up to the mission's key element, either being the generator, or the first glance of Roarmulus Twins' design.

- `Intel had reported a gremlin deconstruction crew dismantling a portion of the Clockworks in order to generate scrap resources for use in their Project R. Using powerful welding torches, they are truly burning the place to the ground. One of the squads investigating the site has gone missing and is believed to be now held in captivity at the site. Infiltrate the fiery deconstruction zone and rescue the captive knights. But be warned, the deconstruction crew are said to have a powerful security construct hidden somewhere on site` (<a href="https://wiki.spiralknights.com/High_Temperature_Hostages" target="_blank">High Temperature Hostages</a>). It suggests, that the process of Project R construction is done with a high pace.

  It is also here <a href="https://wiki.spiralknights.com/Lichen#Oiler" target="_blank">oilers</a> are found, with a visible presence of abundant slime, seen previously in the context of the document in the end of Herex's compound 42.

- `A gremlin logging operation has been discovered in levels known as the 'Jigsaw Valley'. These strangely carved islands are home to an even stranger species of twisting trees that gremlins seems to be determined to completely wipe out. Spiral HQ believes that gremlins are using the lumber from this operation as resources for the development of Project R and needs you to enter the Jigsaw Valley and shut it down` (<a href="https://wiki.spiralknights.com/Axes_of_Evil" target="_blank">Axes of Evil</a>).

It is here we should delve into the final assessment of the wood found across Clockworks.

##### Twisting Trees and Wyverns

Here we build upon the previous introduction of ironwood and other types of wood, as ones with fictional properties. It is within the context of Roarmulus Twins Redwood and other types of trees are also worth noting outside of the analysis of alchemy of ironmight equipment specifically due to the context of <a href="https://wiki.spiralknights.com/Axes_of_Evil" target="_blank">Axes of Evil</a> mission: `A gremlin logging operation has been discovered in levels known as the 'Jigsaw Valley'. These strangely carved islands are home to an even stranger species of twisting trees that gremlins seems to be determined to completely wipe out`.

Gremlins were harvesting trees of <a href="https://wiki.spiralknights.com/Aurora_Isles" target="_blank">Aurora Isles</a>, described as twisting. At the end of the mission knight is rewarded with the <a href="https://wiki.spiralknights.com/Redwood_Bracelet" target="_blank">Redwood Bracelet</a>. This seems as a direct connection between the type of wood of those twisting trees and the bracelet, both being made of redwood. Extrapolating this idea on other types of wood, we can make a solid suggestion that all of those twisting trees correspond to types of wood found across Clockworks due to existence of other types of bracelets - <a href="https://wiki.spiralknights.com/Driftwood_Bracelet" target="_blank">driftwood</a> and <a href="https://wiki.spiralknights.com/Ironwood_Bracelet" target="_blank">ironwood</a>, - but also suggest that those trees were present during the existence of the Ironmight kingdom, be it already on Cradle or a different planet, potentially in place of <a href="https://wiki.spiralknights.com/Aurora_Isles" target="_blank">Aurora Isles</a> as both are practically identical.

Then there is the <a href="https://wiki.spiralknights.com/Wyrmwood_Bracelet" target="_blank">Wyrmwood bracelet</a>. All of bracelets made of wood grant resistance to shock, and they have a parity to according materials based on naming convention, color, and star rating. Among them Wyrmwood bracelet is only 5-tar trinket, and there is no 5-star variant of wood, as ironwood is the last material in this roster, being 4 stars. We suggest, that is a type of wood which is called wyrmwood.

But, wyrmwood in real world is not wood. If looked from a context of other bracelet trinkets, they make wyrmwood seem as a different type of wood, one surpassing ironwood in its properties, based on the star rating. We can also figure out what wyrmwood looks like based on other bracelets:

- <a href="https://wiki.spiralknights.com/Driftwood_Bracelet" target="_blank">Driftwood Bracelet</a> has pale brown color scheme, as driftwood inventory icon. Driftwood bracelet it is acquired for 5 forge sparks.
- <a href="https://wiki.spiralknights.com/Redwood_Bracelet" target="_blank">Redwood Bracelet</a> has bright red color scheme, while redwood inventory icon has pale red or pink color. redwood bracelet is acquired for 20 forge sparks.
- <a href="https://wiki.spiralknights.com/Ironwood_Bracelet" target="_blank">Ironwood Bracelet</a> same as ironwood inventory icon has metallic grey color scheme. Ironwood bracelet is acquired for 50 forge sparks.
- <a href="https://wiki.spiralknights.com/Wyrmwood_Bracelet" target="_blank">Wyrmwood Bracelet</a> is bright green and is acquired for 100 forge sparks.

As it was mentioned, wyrmwood is not wood, but its name is translated to wormwood, reminiscent of dragons and their sub-species in earlier sections, when existence of wyverns was suggested. Considering a more fantastic setting of Spiral Knights and more direct inspiration and naming parity of names, here we suggest, a parallel can be drawn between wyrmwood, wyverns, celestial ore, and sun silver, going beyond bitter taste of real world wormwood.

One particular inspiration we suggest taking place here. Ironwood is a forest in norse mythology, inhabited by jotun. We have previously suggested that in the context of norse mythology, valkyries of heavenly kingdom could have interacted with tortomega. At the same time gremlins were harvesting redwood from the floating isles, which we have established to belong to tortomega based on its' ruins designs and gun puppy statues. Tortomega, as constructs, drop sun silver, which we have proposed being refined celestial ore, relation to heavens due to its description.

So, could it be that wyrmwood is an instance of the heavenly wood? We believe, considering its presence, it could. The fact that this wood grants most protection of shock status, seem to suggest its origins connected to sky, such as owlites' developments and storm chaser elemental. Here a connection to heavens also could be established though the presence of wyverns, potential descendants of dragons, which we have concluded being a unique specie.

As for the Roarmulus Twins, we suggest that at least ironwood was harvested to construct its armor. It is unknown weather wyrmwood was intended to be used, but, judging of different properties of wood, it is likely to possess a far different set of attributes, rather than ones used to construct sturdy armor.

##### Gun Puppies: From Dragons to Red Roarmulus Twins

We have proposed, the tier 1 gun puppies were made of stone, designed and created by descendants of dragons - tortomega, to imitate dragons. Howlitzers became undead drakes. Tier 2 and 3 variants are manufactured by gremlins.

This idea is based on the design of tier 1 gun puppies, specifically, their outer shells being made of stone as well as lacking more complex metal designs of the rest of gremlin constructs, apart from lumbers.

As with the topic of the collector, elemental gremlin technology is also present for gun puppies and rocket puppies. Specifically in the form of elemental variants. By that we mean only tier 1 gun puppies were invented by tortomega, as only they possess consistent stone design, without any complex forms or separate jaw, as tier 2 and above, and elemental variants.

It can be argued that rocket puppy is on the same primitive design, but it would seem anachronistic fot tortomega utilize rockets. But, even this argument considered, tortodrones can be brought up, as they are the most effective demonstration of military abilities of tortomega civilization, albeit focused on minerals and stone. Considering it, we lean to tier 1 rocket puppies being also of that older age.

Elemental gun puppies, on the other hand, do not have bolted foundation and generally look more arcane with spiral design incorporated in their every aspect. But here we should note a common element found across many manufactured equipment - the 3-dot triangular shape present, which is unique for high-tech equipments and devices.

##### Red Roarmulus Twins

Apart from those design, we should look at both Roarmulus Twins and Red Roarmulus twins. In this context the latter are far more hazardous looking, as they seem structurally unstable as well as lacking any gremlin writings present on regular Roarmulus Twins. The description of the shadow Ironclaw munition factory with the design of its enemies seem to suggest that it is not an uncommon design choice, but rather extrapolated onto larger constructs, reminiscent of more deteriorated state of corrupted tortodrones and elemental gun puppies, as if the introduction of elemental amplifies one aspects of the construction and reduces the other, design-wise.

And it is through gun puppies we can observe an extent to which gremlin technology taps into elemental properties, but also shadow, which will be important in relation to the design of Clockworks proper.

Fiery variant of gun puppies - <a href="https://wiki.spiralknights.com/Gun_puppies#Red_Rover" target="_blank">Red Rovers</a> and <a href="https://wiki.spiralknights.com/Gun_puppies#Gun_Puppy" target="_blank">regular Gun Puppies</a> are in a unique position as they have boss variants presented as Roarmulus Twins. While gun puppies might not be of such great interest for us, apart from mentioned gremlin writings on the armor plates, the Red Roarmulus Twins are. In reality, those writings can be distinguished only through direct view of the Red Roarmulus Twins' texture, which does seem as they are not intended to be seen.

Red Rovers have an attack same as Lord Vanaduke in his last phase, which partially demonstrates the extent of powers of the cursed entity. But, at that, only tier 3 red rovers are seen to be explicitly burning, with visible glow between the joints of the armor plates, as well as glowing slab on top. Red Roarmulus twins have only external layer of armor plates damaged by fire, while the internal components are seemingly red-hot, similar to red rovers. At that, the construction of lasers is also unique, as they are red, which are encountered only one more time in Warmaster Seerus's chamber.

The very existence of far more hazardous construction of the facility, as well as the state of Red Roarmulus Twins, we believe, demonstrates the extent at which elemental properties can be integrated in gremlin technology, albeit with a greater risks of the resulting constructing seeming more unstable, that is judging by Red Roarmulus Twins' and elemental gun puppies' designs.

#### Jelly Kingdom and Slimes

For the first time lichens and the existence of slime family of monsters was introduced in <a href="https://wiki.spiralknights.com/Alien_Ooze" target="_blank">Alien Ooze mission</a>, where Spiral Order has concluded, that lichens had arrived on a meteor: `Lichens are an alien species of the slime family thought to have come to the Clockworks via a meteor that crashed on to the surface of Cradle` (<a href="https://wiki.spiralknights.com/Alien_Ooze" target="_blank">Alien Ooze</a>).

There are 2 distinct categories of slimes in the slime family, - lichens which make up lichen colonies, and jellies. The main factor allowing for such classification is the design of both lifeforms - essentially their viscosity and stability of form as 2 distinguishing factors. We believe, jellies are the descendant, or rather, matured lichens. A following comparison of those species outlines their similarities and distinct features.

Both species have a distinct core. There are instances of multiple cores, making up sentient colonies (`Lichens are an alien species of the slime family ... formed from innumerable smaller slimes that form mobile, sentient 'colonies.'` - <a href="https://wiki.spiralknights.com/Alien_Ooze" target="_blank">Alien Ooze</a>), as well as large royal jellies.

A notion could be established here, that of both sentient lichen colonies of multiple cores and larger jellies function as a single, unified organisms, capable of higher mental functions as evident by existence of a monarchy of royal jellies.

This monarchy is embodied by <a href="https://wiki.spiralknights.com/Jelly_King" target="_blank">Jelly King's</a> and <a href="https://wiki.spiralknights.com/Ice_Queen" target="_blank">Ice Queen's</a> [crowns](<(https://wiki.spiralknights.com/Royal_Jelly_Crown)>) having many of common elements of an Imperial Crown.

- `monsters within the slime family actually have a ruling aristocracy of elite slimes` (<a href="https://wiki.spiralknights.com/Another_Trace" target="_blank">Another Trace - Kora</a>).
- `The Royal Jelly Palace has frozen over and its king usurped by the true heir to the slimy throne, the frigid Ice Queen!` [Release Notes: 2011.10.19](https://wiki.spiralknights.com/Release_Notes_2011-10-19).
- `A regal crown resembling that ever-frigid Ice Queen. In addition to providing great defense, it is said to dramatically boost one's ego and create a cold detachment from those around them` (<a href="https://wiki.spiralknights.com/Ice_Queen_Crown" target="_blank">Ice Queen Crown</a>).

We known that those core-like objects are called cores based on the line of slime core items, as follows, with several notes:

- <a href="https://wiki.spiralknights.com/Gel_Core" target="_blank">Gel Core</a>. As it is used in alchemy of <a href="https://wiki.spiralknights.com/Jelly_Helm" target="_blank">Jelly Helm</a>: `Gelatinous headgear made from gooey guardians.` - we can guess that those jellies' role is likely of guards, as it is those who guard entrance to the <a href="https://wiki.spiralknights.com/Garden_of_Goo" target="_blank">Garden of Goo</a> behind <a href="https://wiki.spiralknights.com/Royal_Jelly_Palace" target="_blank">palace's walls</a>.
- <a href="https://wiki.spiralknights.com/Brute_Core" target="_blank">Brute Core</a>: `An oozing blue lump from a particularly potent gelatinous opponent`.

  - `A hardy helm crafted from overly oppressive ooze` (<a href="https://wiki.spiralknights.com/Brute_Jelly_Helm" target="_blank">Brute Jelly Helm</a>).
  - `A firm set of mucilaginous mail crafted from the remains of particularly antagonistic jellies.` (<a href="https://wiki.spiralknights.com/Brute_Jelly_Mail" target="_blank">Brute Jelly Mail</a>) The brute slime in question, considering medieval themes of jelly kingdom and throne, is likely an offensive unit of jelly army.

- <a href="https://wiki.spiralknights.com/Toxic_Core" target="_blank">Toxic Core</a>: `A solid, pulsating lump that oozes with vitriol`.
- <a href="https://wiki.spiralknights.com/Zee_Core" target="_blank">Zee Core</a>: `A pungent mass pulled from a slimy assailant. Its aroma is an excellent remedy for insomnia, as well as nighttime sniffling and sneezing`.
- <a href="https://wiki.spiralknights.com/Rocky_Core" target="_blank">Rocky Core</a>: `A delicious gummy treat with an impenetrable rocky shell. More than a few teeth have been lost by knights attempting to get at the gooey interior`.

  Considering themes of sturdiness of rock gels:

  - `A tough topper tailored from jagged jelly` (<a href="https://wiki.spiralknights.com/Rock_Jelly_Helm" target="_blank">Rock Jelly Helm</a>).
  - `Crafted from the most adamant of slimy specimens, it also functions as an emergency source of calories for stranded knights` (<a href="https://wiki.spiralknights.com/Rock_Jelly_Shield" target="_blank">Rock Jelly Shield</a>).
  - `This gelatinous gear combines the sturdiness of stone with the piercing protection of sticky goo. its a wonder that you managed to beat up the jelly this is made out of` (<a href="https://wiki.spiralknights.com/Rock_Jelly_Mail" target="_blank">Rock Jelly Mail</a>).

  We can suggest those being the heavy infantry of the kingdom, as well as them being the closest to royalty, as they have 4-star rarity.

- <a href="https://wiki.spiralknights.com/Royal_Core" target="_blank">Royal Core</a>: `A sweet-smelling lump of ooze collected from a particularly noble specimen of slime`. And attributed to it equipment such as <a href="https://wiki.spiralknights.com/Royal_Jelly_Mail" target="_blank">Royal Jelly Mail</a>: `A viciously viscous set of armor crafted painstakingly from the most noble specimens of quivering slime`.

These cores demonstrate color variation in types of jellies, but also their properties and taste. The latter is specified by the alchemy tree of jelly shields:

- <a href="https://wiki.spiralknights.com/Rock_Jelly_Shield" target="_blank">Rock Jelly Shield</a>: `it also functions as an emergency source of calories for stranded knights`.
- `it is durable, light, and delightfully berry-flavored` (<a href="https://wiki.spiralknights.com/Brute_Jelly_Shield" target="_blank">Brute Jelly Shield</a>).

This attribute, with consideration of danger is slime (`Please note that members of the slime monster family (jellies, lichens, polyps, glop drops, Royal Jelly, Ice Queen) are not edible and should not be ingested under any circumstance, despite the fact that some may resemble a confection` - <a href="https://forums.spiralknights.com/en/node/102352" target="_blank">Regarding Slimes</a>), can be explained through a property of not real-world lichen, but of tropical frogs due to the contrast color being a sign of toxicity, as a lead.

It is known that at least lichens arrived on a meteor, and, due to anatomical and biological similarity of jellies and lichens, we consider both being alien to Cradle. Apart from it, jellies, and specifically royal slimes, have visible core as large lichen colonies. Considering the approximate habitats of both species, we propose, that jellies are matured lichens, lichen colonies and polyps, whose development, with the preexisting sentience in the form of colonies allowed for a civilization to emerge, a kingdom.

It is also important to mention a color shift of lichen colonies as they grow larger. Lichen colonies as well as jellies both are also capable of extending their spikes through the ground - this trait is particularly unique in general context to connect both species to a common ancestor, which, as we have suggested, are lichens, specifically yellow lichens.

Under this logic it is the left ambiguous, how so creatures like blast cubes, toxigels, slooms, and by proxy void gels came to existence, as they look and act practically same as lichens, yet have a single larger core. We will keep them in mnd until later discussion.

On the other hand, there are minis, <a href="https://wiki.spiralknights.com/Shankle" target="_blank">shankles</a>, and <a href="https://wiki.spiralknights.com/Glop_Drop" target="_blank">glop drops</a>, which lack a distinct core:

- Minis are originated of polyps, as implied by the throne room of the Royal Jelly Palace.
- Drops are widespread in compounds and treasure vaults, which contains a third specie of slimes - shankles. Yet, based on the tier 3 designs, there is a possibility of them possessing a core, which can be reshaped, or at least an inner glow.
- Shankles are only specie which have a distinct biological features, such as an eye and mouth. Considering the behavior of mimics, we can suggest those were in proximity of gremlin settlements and facilities. But, they do have an implication of an existing hierarchy, as <a href="https://wiki.spiralknights.com/Treasure_Mimic" target="_blank">Treasure Mimic's</a> tendrils have a crown of an imperial design. Through the presence of tendrils and their behavior - as ones emerging from the ground, - we can confirm, that shankles are sub-specie of slimes, diegetically.

##### Gremlin Bioengineering And Purposed Organisms

Across the suggested physiology of slimes, existence of toxins, toxoils, and quicksilvers seem to become more nuanced.

We propose, that during games's event both gremlins and Spiral Order had gained understanding of slime physiology, which allowed for both to develop their own technology. In case of gremlins it is creation of artificial lichens, and for Spiral Order their research resulted in the Slime Node gear.

It is important to establish, which slimes we consider artificial as well as describe the reasoning behind this logic.

##### Blast Cubes

Blast Cubes are first artificial slimes manufactured by gremlins. We believe they are as such due to their unique and unstable property to explode - this characteristic is not observed anywhere else, nor in any slime family.

Yet, blast cubes and explosive blocks, and Collector's bombs seem to have a common nature. This seems less of budget restriction, but an intentional design choice guided by gremlin technological advancements. Yet, while there is existence of a link between compound 42 and toxic gels, there is no such link for blast cubes.

They have a peculiar variation in color, transitioning from yellow, to reddish crimson, and to purple depending on Clockworks tier. Visible cracked blackened edges on all variants which give impression of cooler areas on top of heated surface, reminiscent of molten metal dross.

In the latter two variants blast cubes possess lightning arcs around the core within the main body of slime.

They they are damaged enough, stability of surrounding slime seem to falter, as more lightnings emerge from the core and confinement of main body of slime across all variants. In the very final moment the core explodes, suggesting that it is the energy source for the slime. This collapse is also characteristic of larger jellies, such as Ice Queen or Jelly King.

##### Diegesis of Explosive Blocks

As Blast Cubes function very similar to Explosive Blocks, we have to look at those within the context of they placement in the story. They are most strangely present in Scarlet Fortress. This becomes a question of their canon, as some elements, such as respawn pads, we believe, are not diegetic. Weather this can be said of explosive blocks, we could not say with full certainty. The same can be attributed to higher tier gun puppies, such as those present in <a href="https://wiki.spiralknights.com/Firestorm_Citadel/Charred_Court" target="_blank">Firestorm Citadel's Charred Court</a>. As far as we are aware of gremlin technology, and as we mentioned it previously - a small chance of gremlins attempting to control Firestorm Citadel exists, mainly due to ambiguity of elevators. But in the current context, with those assumptions in mind, we can more certainly say of blast cube's origins.

##### Toxigels, Oilers, Toxoils

Toxins and oilers are placed together mainly due to the events of compound 42.

Based on the memos in the facility (`it seems to have formed an intelligence well beyond the scope of a standard bio-toxin` - <a href="https://wiki.spiralknights.com/Compound_42/Containment" target="_blank">Compound 42 - Containment - Herex</a>), it seems that the biological weapon in question was not intended to become such. But, a plausible explanation can be suggested, as the weapon was derived of slimes.

Event of the Vile Engine seem to suggest that the slime generator, while in-game were seen to produce quicksilver lichens, are in fact capable of both, judging by the outer regions of generators' influence, resulting in creation of the Rotting Metropolis.

As for the oilers, as tubes of oil are found in the eng of the compound seems as an evidence of their artificial nature and the fact toxigels and oilers were mixed to create toxoils unique to compound 42. It is also notable, that, when oiler is ignited, its core also burns, making it visible only in such state. This industrial motif is also present for quicksilver lichens.

##### Quicksilver Lichens

As toxigels and toxoils were purposed to become bioweapons, as blast cubes were devised as mobile bombs, as oiler were used in the heating and smelting facilities, quicksilvers, we believe, are also artificial purposed organisms.

The first element is lichens' name. Quicksilver is an archaic term for mercury. The design of lichens suggest it being true, as quicksilver has same reflective properties.

While a connection between mercury and healing may not relate to anything in particular, it is important to look as other aspects of their design and themes, present across Spiral Order equipment - the <a href="https://wiki.spiralknights.com/Quicksilver_Mail" target="_blank">quicksilver armor</a> alchemy tree, including <a href="https://wiki.spiralknights.com/Mercurial_Demo_Suit" target="_blank">Mercurial Demo set</a>.

The persisting theme is one of electricity:

- `A fine set of mail made of what was once a Quicksilver` (<a href="https://wiki.spiralknights.com/Quicksilver_Mail" target="_blank">Quicksilver Mail</a>). Despite referring to mercury in the past tense, the mail remain with this name. Quicksilver in this context might mean the lichen, as alchemy of the next in line upgrade - <a href="https://wiki.spiralknights.com/Charged_Quicksilver_Mail" target="_blank">Charged quicksilver Mail</a> contains all of the familiar slime-related materials, such as gel cores, <a href="https://wiki.spiralknights.com/Brute_Core" target="_blank">Brute Core</a> and <a href="https://wiki.spiralknights.com/Gel_Core" target="_blank">Gel Core</a>, and potentially <a href="https://wiki.spiralknights.com/Volt_Oil" target="_blank">Volt Oil</a> specifically.
- <a href="https://wiki.spiralknights.com/Charged_Quicksilver_Mail" target="_blank">Charged Quicksilver Mail</a> is a direct upgrade of the prior with instruction of <a href="https://wiki.spiralknights.com/Thunderball" target="_blank">Thunderball</a> into its alchemy.

  The description of <a href="https://wiki.spiralknights.com/Charged_Quicksilver_Helm" target="_blank">its charged helm</a> - `An enhanced Quicksilver Helm conductive to the destruction of electrical foes.` - might suggest that it is a state of armor, or rather, mercury itself, within which charged quicksilver lichens are encountered.

- The final upgrade, <a href="https://wiki.spiralknights.com/Mercurial_Mail" target="_blank">Mercurial Mail</a> - `A supreme set of silver armor that'll put a spring in your step while keeping shocks out of it`, and <a href="https://wiki.spiralknights.com/Mercurial_Helm" target="_blank">Mercurial Helm</a> - `A sublime silver helmet that'll let you move as swiftly as water, though perhaps not quite so swiftly *through* it` have an emphasis on this armor's defense supremacy and speed.
- Same characteristic of speed is found in the <a href="https://wiki.spiralknights.com/Mercurial_Demo_Suit" target="_blank">Mercurial Demo Suit</a> set: `A demo suit made from gremlin technology. It is for the bomber that wants a boost of speed, more power and a greatly reduced chance of dying by electrocution`.

  While it is indeed stated that the armor utilizes gremlin technology, most prominently <a href="https://wiki.spiralknights.com/Gremlonium" target="_blank">Gremlonium</a>: `A highly advanced compound created by gremlin engineers to power their most devious machines. It constantly emits an unsettling hissing sound`. we propose that there is greater symbolic and alchemical meaning to be found, which will be analyzed after the initial coverage of Clockworks' infrastructure.

But currently, as far as initial role of quicksilver lichens go, they seem to represent a utilitarian role of batteries, as their gel os found across complex, highly dangerous facilities, specifically, <a href="https://wiki.spiralknights.com/Ironclaw_Munitions_Factory" target="_blank">Ironclaw Munitions Factory</a>. Moreover, quicksilver lichens are produced by <a href="https://wiki.spiralknights.com/The_Vile_Engine/Processing_Plant" target="_blank">slime generators</a> during the Vile Engine mission.

We have already discussed the nature of the Rotting Metropolis, using it to interpret existence of those generator in favour of Herex. Yet, the description `It would seem as though those slime generators have been around much longer than we thought, seeping their vile toxins into any levels that should be near them` (<a href="https://wiki.spiralknights.com/The_Rotting_Metropolis" target="_blank">The Rotting Metropolis</a>) is particularly vague.

Despite both subspecies of lichens being artificial, we can't currently explain this inconsistency, apart from it being an implication of an artificial nature of both quicksilver lichens and toxigels.

##### Node Field

To known characteristics of slime family, <a href="https://forums.spiralknights.com/en/node/102352" target="_blank">nodes</a>, specifically Node Field, as suggested by a <a href="https://wiki.spiralknights.com/Node_Field_Aura#Node_Field_Aura" target="_blank">Node Field aura</a> serves as an artificial analogue. We believe creation of node field, powered by the energy, is Spiral Order's attempt in artificial creation of slime for means of protection.

Considering that the gel core is essential to lichens and jellies, with exception of minis and shankles, it serves essentially as a heart and nerve center, as those make up sentient colonies. Gel Core is plausibly capable of producing slime gel, similar to bone marrow. In case of Spiral Order Node equipment, the slime is held stable by 2 elements - a gel core, and an element which likely contains energy, and is present across most of regular gear.

Within this context node slime equipment - <a href="https://wiki.spiralknights.com/Node_Slime_Guards" target="_blank">Guards</a>, <a href="https://wiki.spiralknights.com/Node_Slime_Mask" target="_blank">Mask</a>, <a href="https://wiki.spiralknights.com/Node_Slime_Crusher" target="_blank">Crusher</a>, <a href="https://wiki.spiralknights.com/Node_Slime_Wall" target="_blank">Wall</a>, - all of those items, as previous batch of gear such as <a href="https://wiki.spiralknights.com/Rock_Jelly_Shield" target="_blank">Rock Jelly Shield</a>, contain a core. But here it is far more distinct, it pulses energy in a specific pattern. This glowing pattern can be extended to an <a href="https://wiki.spiralknights.com/Node_Field_Aura#Node_Field_Aura" target="_blank">aura</a>. But, both node Field and internal translucent structure of <a href="https://wiki.spiralknights.com/Royal_Jelly_Shield" target="_blank">Royal Jelly Shield</a> alchemy tree is very similar, except for the lack of completely connected geometry with no loose nodes.

Here also a definitive design element of slime alchemy is found - in case of the equipment, such as <a href="https://wiki.spiralknights.com/Jelly_Shield" target="_blank">Jelly Shield</a>, to alchemize if both slime's core and gel are required. <a href="https://wiki.spiralknights.com/Node_Container" target="_blank">Node Container</a> has a specific role, mainly due to combination of its name and function - to contain and potentially stabilize the gel, held together by the glowing cores in the same manner as the energy symbol on shields is meant to convey their underlying technology and diegetic game mechanic of spherical shield, and as gel cores are essential for larger slimes.

One particular element then remains, that of <a href="https://wiki.spiralknights.com/Node_Field_Aura#Node_Field_Aura" target="_blank">Node Field aura</a> itself, as it extends past the knight into the surroundings. At the same time, the <a href="https://wiki.spiralknights.com/Slime_Prize_Box#Calendar" target="_blank">promotional material</a> also depicts what seems to be Node Field covered chamber.

Due to this design choice we lean to a conclusion that the Node Field, at first, is a technology. But, as its design differs greatly from the rest of Spiral Order equipment, we have to assume that it is derived from a different place and time, as far as this concept can go. And to hold the structure of the gel itself through those artificial means, <a href="https://wiki.spiralknights.com/Jelly_Glue" target="_blank">Gel Glue</a> was manufactured: `A viscous compound developed by Biotechs to allow for the study of slime creatures. When mixed with slime and jelly matter, it allows for reshaping without losing its form. Though reserved for scientific purposes, the process is generally regarded as 'super fun'`.

##### Starlight Cradle and Ancient Titans

Then, there is Starlight Cradle, while it is of the same nature as the rest of Aurora Isles, it is distinguished by the presence of sleep mist, instrumental to its design, feel, and themes: `Beneath a moonlit sky azure islands drift in a sea of stars. These islands are home to creatures that are more than happy to creep upon those who succumb to this world's endless lullaby` (<a href="https://wiki.spiralknights.com/Starlight_Cradle" target="_blank">Starlight Cradle</a>).

Meteor motif within this region in particular is more so interesting, as is it on meteor lichens were supposed to arrive, and the region has Meteor Mile in 3 different variants of a fixed layout. This seems intentional, both in naming and design. Not particularly related to the region, a <a href="https://wiki.spiralknights.com/File:Scenario_Room-Lichenous_Lair_1.png" target="_blank">scenario room with a smoldering meteor</a> exist, but, it seems to be too recent of an event, due to burning fires. Due to this, we believe that this is not the original meteor lichens had arrived on Cradle, but, one related. Keeping this in mind, there is also <a href="https://wiki.spiralknights.com/Torporal_Titan" target="_blank">Torporal Titan</a>, but before it, we must look at properties of the gear, alchemized from this region's materials. It is also here, at Meteor Mile 2, we can see a direct parallel and common motif of both Gun Puppy constructs and gun puppy statues placed nearby.

Among currently present sequences of levels, only <a href="https://wiki.spiralknights.com/Torporal_Titan" target="_blank">Torporal Titan</a> lacks a narrative in its name. <a href="https://wiki.spiralknights.com/Dark_City/Stygian_Steeds" target="_blank">Stygian Steeds</a> were present during the events of the Return of Ur, as the stygian, or Underworld, steeds are trojans of the legion of Ur, as they were sealed in the Underworld. And <a href="https://wiki.spiralknights.com/Concrete_Jungle/Briar_Bone_Barrage" target="_blank">Briar Bone Barrage</a> is seemingly named after a unique encounter with <a href="https://wiki.spiralknights.com/Toxilargo#Toxilargo" target="_blank">Toxilargo</a>, but here we can rely on previous levels, whose names mark the extent of the poisonous miasma.

The location of Starlight Cradle is more structurally intact compared to the rest of the regions of, initially, the same biome. As the rest of Aurora Isles, this region had also been populated by tortomega, but, due to relation to meteors and unique state lichens are found in, it was overtaken by the latter in the same manner as royal jelly palace. Potentially being the source of all lichens. Yet, this would not explain nature of sleep here, which we will analyze next.

Themes of stars and sleep are related. Most of the related to this location gear uses <a href="https://wiki.spiralknights.com/Zee_Core" target="_blank">Zee Core</a> (`A pungent mass pulled from a slimy assailant. Its aroma is an excellent remedy for insomnia, as well as nighttime sniffling and sneezing` - <a href="https://wiki.spiralknights.com/Zee_Core" target="_blank">Zee Core</a>) in its alchemy:

- <a href="https://wiki.spiralknights.com/Starlit_Demo_Suit" target="_blank">Starlit Demo Suit</a> 5-star armor has usage of both <a href="https://wiki.spiralknights.com/Royal_Core" target="_blank">Royal Core</a>, a 5-star slime-themed material, and <a href="https://wiki.spiralknights.com/Meteor_Mote" target="_blank">Meteor Mote</a>, which is stated to be used by gremlins: `A small piece of a rare material that is said to have fallen from the sky. Gremlins typically use it in the construction of power sources`.

  This further suggests this region being related to meteors in the context of lichens' arrival to Cradle. Considering that the meteor had to end up at Cradle's surface, and the Aurora Isles are particularly aerial region, this might not be a coincidence, but an intentional decision for both explaining lichens' origins and to disclose more regions of tortomega civilization beyond Wildwoods and general Aurora Isles.

  The latter, notably, we now know are the place of Ironwood to be harvested, relating back to the question of the resources required to potentially construct tortodrones in the first place, and then Roarmulus Twins by gremlins. The fact meteor mote is stated to be used by gremlins, the way we see it, is the expansion upon the industrial application of lichens.

  Although, this could simply be the fact gremlins harvest all of natural resources, unrelated to lichens.

- `An advanced, star-soaked hunting coat that will keep you awake even as it coddles you in downy comfort` (<a href="https://wiki.spiralknights.com/Starlit_Hunting_Coat" target="_blank">Starlit Hunting Coat</a>). A wording of star-soaked is peculiar - as it is unknown weather this is a metaphor. If this property is to be interpreted literally, then, we are thinking of the sleep-inducing mist, naturally secreted by <a href="https://wiki.spiralknights.com/Sloom#Sloom" target="_blank">Slooms</a> and <a href="https://wiki.spiralknights.com/Sloombargo#Sloombargo" target="_blank">Sloombargos</a>.

  This mist then is addressed directly:

  - `A powerful alchemical bomb that creates a thick fog of sleepy mist` (<a href="https://wiki.spiralknights.com/Slumber_Squall" target="_blank">Slumber Squall</a>).
  - `A Slumber Smogger modified to disperse sleepy smog over a wider range` (<a href="https://wiki.spiralknights.com/Slumber_Smogger_Mk_II" target="_blank">Slumber Smogger Mk II</a>).
  - `An alchemical bomb that fogs an area with a sleep agent` (<a href="https://wiki.spiralknights.com/Slumber_Smogger" target="_blank">Slumber Smogger</a>).
  - `An illuminated helm strengthened against soporific smogs. its surprisingly soft inside` (<a href="https://wiki.spiralknights.com/Starlit_Demo_Helm" target="_blank">Starlit Demo Helm</a>).
  - `An advanced hunting cap, illuminated and downy, that resists the strongest sleep mists` (<a href="https://wiki.spiralknights.com/Starlit_Hunting_Cap" target="_blank">Starlit Hunting Cap</a>).

  The nature of this mist will be important later.

- `Something has really riled up the Chromalisks in the levels below the town of Emberlight. Spiral HQ sent a squad in to investigate and they quickly fell off the radar. Now they've sent out a distress signal stating that they're cornered at depth 21 by chromalisks of all varieties. Biotechs speculate these chromalisks are agitated due to their proximity to the Core` (<a href="https://wiki.spiralknights.com/In_Cold_Blood" target="_blank">In Cold Blood</a>). This mission ends in the location, by the gate icon and by its design, in the Starlight Cradle - <a href="https://wiki.spiralknights.com/In_Cold_Blood/Lizard_Lounge" target="_blank">Lizard Lounge</a>.
- <a href="https://wiki.spiralknights.com/Sloom#Sloom" target="_blank">Slooms</a> and <a href="https://wiki.spiralknights.com/Sloombargo#Sloombargo" target="_blank">Sloombargos</a> have a unique design of spikes, which are covered with ornamen glowing patterns.

  This shattered or cracked design is similar to other entities, such as <a href="https://wiki.spiralknights.com/Gorgo#Gorgo" target="_blank">Gorgos</a>, Margrel, <a href="https://wiki.spiralknights.com/Tortodrone" target="_blank">corrupted tortodrones</a>, and <a href="https://wiki.spiralknights.com/Trojan" target="_blank">trojans</a>. Although all of those examples are some of other way relate to Underworld, we believe this case, sleep is not related to Underworld, but it demonstrates a potentially different concept.

- Items of <a href="https://wiki.spiralknights.com/Slumber_Prize_Box" target="_blank">Slumber Prize Box</a> also relate to this region through the color scheme.
- <a href="https://wiki.spiralknights.com/Lockbox#Slime_Lockbox" target="_blank">Slime Lockbox</a> also contains trinkets relating to a time of day - 3-star <a href="https://wiki.spiralknights.com/Early_Riser_Ring" target="_blank">Early Riser Ring</a>, 4-star <a href="https://wiki.spiralknights.com/Dawn_Bracelet" target="_blank">Dawn Bracelet</a>, 5-star <a href="https://wiki.spiralknights.com/Daybreaker_Band" target="_blank">Daybreaker Band</a>, all being synonyms of dawn.
- <a href="https://wiki.spiralknights.com/Jelly_shield" target="_blank">Jelly Shield</a> alchemy tree, including <a href="https://wiki.spiralknights.com/Savage_Tortoise" target="_blank">Savage Tortoise</a>, provide sleep resistance.

  We have earlier proposed, that <a href="https://wiki.spiralknights.com/Savage_Tortoise" target="_blank">Savage Tortoise</a> was designed by Owlites, but, there're no evidence of lichens existing that far into the past, not evidence of Owlites combating lichens. Although, it would not conflict with the existing timeline of events. More potential connections arise from earlier upgrades - `A shield alchemized from a hardened tortodrone shell. its tough enough to dull a jelly barb on impact` (<a href="https://wiki.spiralknights.com/Wild_Shell" target="_blank">Wild Shield</a>). In fact, we still do not known the nature of explicitly hardened shells derived of tortodrones.

  As for the regular, jelly, line of upgrades, we are out of valid explanations for their nature, apart from a potential concept of lichens originating from this mist-covered biome, but this would conflict with an aforementioned scenario room of a meteor, as only regular lichens emerge from the meteor.

- <a href="https://wiki.spiralknights.com/Purrfect_Katnip_Pouch" target="_blank">Purrfect Katnip Pouch</a> provides sleep resistance and is acquired for 100 <a href="https://wiki.spiralknights.com/Primal_Spark#Treasure_Box_Tokens" target="_blank">Primal Sparks</a>, design-wise it is fitting.
- <a href="https://wiki.spiralknights.com/Somnambulist%27s_Totem" target="_blank">Somnambulist's totem</a>: `An ordinary object with a unique texture and weight, the result of having been partially digested by a Sloombargo`. Naming of a totem is peculiar, as there are only 2 other instances of a totem naming scheme being used, - gremlin and Underworld devices. As Apocrea was mention within the <a href="https://forums.spiralknights.com/en/node/111472" target="_blank">memorandum</a>, and we have briefly mentioned it, here, we can focus on this concept. This naming of a totem within the context of Apocrea could be referencing Lovecraft's shot story "Hypnos" and broader Dream Cycle.

We propose that at the center of region's identity and reason for its in-universe existence is the nature of the sleep mist, and it is one derived from tortomega. This connection we make due to the earlier lack of context for the Torporal Titan. Naming convention of titan is very rare and is used selectively upon items and places with at least some background:

- For ancient equipment acquired for <a href="https://wiki.spiralknights.com/Token#Almirian_Seal" target="_blank">Almirian Seals</a>: <a href="https://wiki.spiralknights.com/Ancient_Plate_Armor" target="_blank">Ancient Plate Armor</a> and <a href="https://wiki.spiralknights.com/Ancient_Plate_Helm" target="_blank">Ancient Plate Helm</a>, it was relation to moss and immense - titanic (`A vestigial helm whose weight makes it unwieldy to all but those with titanic strength` - <a href="https://wiki.spiralknights.com/Ancient_Plate_Helm" target="_blank">Ancient Plate Helm</a>), - strength, affirmed by the slowness of movement, as the items were made of stone. Here we remember th Ironmight set, which design and buff-wise is similar, yet relates to different epoch of Ironmight kingdom, yet still heavy to induce slowness. It should be noted, that ancient equipment is also detrimental to sleep status effect.
- Titan gates were a key to establishing titans, tortomega, and creators of tortodrones, as a single specie.

And here, <a href="https://wiki.spiralknights.com/Torporal_Titan" target="_blank">Torporal Titan</a> is an unchanging depth of 3 arenas within a seemingly intact location. Considering the context of the location, designed as the rest of Aurora Isles, we believe, this naming convention was intentional. While sleep may be related to titan, that it most likely sleeps, we do not know anything apart from it.

##### Ice Queen

Ice Queen and rest of <a href="https://wiki.spiralknights.com/Ice_Cube#Ice_Cube" target="_blank">Ice Cubes</a> can be grouped together as both have same freeze-related nature. Ice Cubes in particular can be re-frosted through application of frost status effect. As everfrost is extracted from freeze-themed enemies, and if anything, the state Royal Jelly Palace found in, that is most reminiscent of frozen Amu-Sol due to Everfrost's influence, we believe the prior is the same case. As Maulos was involved with Amu-Sol, we suggest freezing of Royal Jelly Palace being of Ice Queen's doing, rather than a natural phenomenon, due to innate nature of Ice Cubes, as they are capable of generating ice on their own will.

Then there is presence of evil eye on Ice Queen's crown, seen both of her variant, and one alchemized in the Sanctuary Alchemy Machine - we rely on it through connection to everfrost, as both had originated from the Underworld. The crown itself is made of <a href="https://wiki.spiralknights.com/Celestial_Ore" target="_blank">Celestial Ore</a>, as suggested by the description of the latter: `It is often completely wasted on crowns and jewelry for slime royalty` (<a href="https://wiki.spiralknights.com/Celestial_Ore" target="_blank">Celestial Ore</a>). It was stated that slimes had overtaken the palace, so it could mean, in conjunction with usage of the ore in valkyrian armor, <a href="https://wiki.spiralknights.com/Heavenly_Iron_Helm" target="_blank">Heavenly Iron Helm</a> specifically, that Ice Queen had found the ore as heavenly kingdom had long gone, and created a crown.

#### Mending Rune and Gremlin Emblem

Gremlin Mending rune is identical to gremlin classification image and also, as it seems from the general appearances of this symbol, is an internally consistent image across gremlin clans. Based on the fact that Crimson Order imagery is consistent across the facilities, we suggest that this more generalized symbol of the rune is the emblem of the Great Colony or Iron Law itself, as all known clans abide to it and by proxy Crimson Order and king Tinkinzar.

Weather it is Great Colony's emblem or symbol of order, might be resolved through the design of <a href="https://wiki.spiralknights.com/Gremlin_Prize_Box" target="_blank">Gremlin Prize Box</a>. It is similar to the depiction of the familiar Spiral Order symbol on the <a href="https://wiki.spiralknights.com/Raiders_Prize_Box" target="_blank">Raider Prize Box</a>. More important is the design of <a href="https://wiki.spiralknights.com/Gremlin_Suit" target="_blank">Gremlin Suit</a>, as on its sleeves there is symbol belonging to the Spiral Order, rather than gremlins.

Due to this, we can also suggest that the Great Colony is a term for a type of military organizational structure, similar to Spiral Order of Isorians. Although the quote `A village of outcasts, Emberlight serves as a refuge for gremlins who were banished from the Great Colony. Now they live humble lives, selling wares and repairs to passing travelers, always fearful that one day the gremlin king Tinkinzar would see fit to wipe them out entirely` (<a href="https://wiki.spiralknights.com/Emberlight" target="_blank">Emberlight</a>) could question this interpretation. At the same time, one could be banished from the Order, a discharge or dismissal. Within this context a position of Emberlight gremlins as traitors seems fitting. Within this theory we will consider Great Colony as a location, a metropolis.

As for the rune and its healing properties, it can be applied by gremlin menders to both other living entities as well constructs, including battlepods. In its behavior it resembles healing field of Silkwings, and the rune's emblem shimmers as the dread seal. Menders cast that rune through usage of a wrench equipped with luminite shard, which may point to identity of the principle behind healing.

There are also <a href="https://wiki.spiralknights.com/Healing_Totem#Healing_Totem" target="_blank">healing totems</a>, found in the Firestorm Citadel after Nature Sprites had began putting out the fires. Those totems also resemble wrenches with mineral shards held within, which function as passive mending. As for their purpose, considering Herex's presence with a large squad of both gremlins and constructs, we suggest totems' placement here is the evidence of them passing through this route.

The color of minerals held in those wrenches is also notable, as those contain dark matter. But, as the alloy is a less consistent application of minerals, compared to the rest, wherein gremlins use only a single type of mineral, it is likely to be, in fact, charged luminite, as mentioned for the first time in the context of <a href="https://wiki.spiralknights.com/Sun_Shards" target="_blank">Sun Shards bomb</a>: `A shard bomb formed from a small explosive encased in solar-charged Luminite. Whatever you do, don't look directly at it` (<a href="https://wiki.spiralknights.com/Sun_Shards" target="_blank">Sun Shards</a>).

Gremlins utilize all minerals in their weapons. Most common example here are the gremlin knockers, which are equipped with 2 wrenches, but each with a different mineral. It seems that it is the interaction between those minerals which causes an explosion, which is weaponized:

- <a href="https://wiki.spiralknights.com/Knocker#Gremlin_Knocker" target="_blank">Knocker</a>: moonstone and crimsonite, inflicts no status effect.
- <a href="https://wiki.spiralknights.com/Knocker#Gremlin_Lighter" target="_blank">Lighter</a>: crimsonite and luminite, inflicts fire.
- <a href="https://wiki.spiralknights.com/Knocker#Gremlin_Cooler" target="_blank">Cooler</a>: valestone and moonstone, inflicts frost
  - <a href="https://wiki.spiralknights.com/Deadly_Crystal_Bomb" target="_blank">Deadly Crystal Bomb</a> consists of moonstone and valestone alloy, elemental damage (`A large chunk of Moonstone and Valestone alloy primed with a potent explosive. Studies have shown that this bomb can be used to reduce a zombie's craving for brains by up to 100% by blowing them to pieces` - <a href="https://wiki.spiralknights.com/Deadly_Crystal_Bomb" target="_blank">Deadly Crystal Bomb</a>).
- <a href="https://wiki.spiralknights.com/Knocker#Gremlin_Choker" target="_blank">Choker</a>: valestone and dark matter, inflicts poison.
- <a href="https://wiki.spiralknights.com/Knocker#Gremlin_Jumper" target="_blank">Jumper</a>: moonstone and dark matter, inflicts shock.

Notably, those are the uncommon-type combinations of minerals found across Clockworks, as evident by the <a href="https://wiki.spiralknights.com/Minerals#Acquisition" target="_blank">mineral frequency table</a>, with moonstone-crimsonite being attributed rather to general gremlin stratum. Could it be, this strategic placement of minerals is explained by the explosive nature of their interactions? But then, why frequent minerals are also present in those speculated to be dangerous combinations?

This emerging relation between minerals' themes, their natures, tethered by their application across Isorian and Gremlin technology made us think of a different notion, of concept of Five Elements in Godai.

Although interpretation within the context of fictional reality of Spiral Knights will differ, we will attempt to look for similarities and common themes, such as the aforementioned relations of statuses and minerals.

For that, minerals' descriptions should be brought to the shortest description:

- Crimsonite - passion, anger, strength
- Dark Matter - chaos, nothingness
- Luminite - faith, wisdom, zeal
- Moonstone - knowledge
- Valestone - essence of life

Dark matter is described as as essence of both chaos and nothingness. We have already discussed how this duality relates back to western alchemy. But what we have not mentioned up until now is the relation to Godai and its concept of the Void or Ku, as its fifth element, in most layman terms here being the abstract of the being, it is the spirit, cosmic Heaven, and Aether. We must point out, Ku currently has no relation to the Void of Whitespace of Spiral Knights, but it has very similar cosmic motif, as Energy is also ever-present.

As here we have to operate though metaphor in far greater aspect, due to topic's nature, we have to be even more careful. At that, we consider minerals in question being embodiments of those principles.

In more metaphorical sense, the very fact of attempting to establish nature of those minerals, while a general understanding was established, we came to a conclusion, best articulated by Carl Jung in the english translation of "Psychology and Alchemy": `The mistaken idea of a merely outward imitatio Christi is further exacerbated by a typically European prejudice which distinguishes the Western attitude from the Eastern. Western man is held in thrall by the "ten thousand things"; he sees only particulars, he is ego-bound and thing-bound, and unaware of the deep root of all being. Eastern man, on the other hand, experiences the world of particulars, and even his own ego, like a dream; he is rooted essentially in the "Ground," which attracts him so powerfully that his relations with the world are relativized to a degree that is often incomprehensible to us. The Western attitude, with its emphasis on the object, tends to fix the ideal—Christ—in its outward aspect and thus to rob it of its mysterious relation to the inner man. It is this prejudice, for instance, which impels the Protestant interpreters of the Bible to interpret (referring to the Kingdom of God) as "among you" instead of "within you." I do not mean to say anything about the validity of the Western attitude: we are sufficiently convinced of its rightness. But if we try to come to a real understanding of Eastern man — as the psychologist must — we find it hard to rid ourselves of certain misgivings. Anyone who can square it with his conscience is free to decide this question as he pleases, though he may be unconsciously setting himself up as an arbiter mundi.`

#### Clockworks and Magitek

When speaking of Clockworks, inevitably Core and Architect had to be brought up as essentials. Here we will attempt to parse them, working downwards from the most present in-game elements.

We begin with the <a href="https://wiki.spiralknights.com/Storm_Chaser" target="_blank">Storm Chaser</a>, which as we remember was the Spark of Life before energy system rework (`The old ‘Spark of Life’ crafting material has been renamed to 'Storm Chaser'` - [Release Notes: 2013.07.30](https://wiki.spiralknights.com/Release_Notes_2013-07-30)). Now it is important.

- <a href="https://wiki.spiralknights.com/Storm_Chaser" target="_blank">Storm Chaser</a> is referenced in <a href="https://wiki.spiralknights.com/Electron_Vortex" target="_blank">Electron Vortex</a> as a payload of unstable organic essence (`An Electron Bomb modified with a payload of unstable organic essence. Foes caught in its punishing radius are cruelly referred to as "thunderstuck"` - <a href="https://wiki.spiralknights.com/Electron_Vortex" target="_blank">Electron Vortex</a>).
- It is used in creation of <a href="https://wiki.spiralknights.com/Voltedge" target="_blank">Voltedge</a>: `Combining Spiral capacitor technology with samples recovered from the Ironclaw Munitions Factory produced the blade, which can output a particularly hazardous 1.21 gigawatt discharge`.

  This would mean that Roarmulus Twins' laser canons utilize Storm Chasers to power themselves, as it the rarities 5-star material, attributed to shock-themed enemies.

Due to this, we can suggest that <a href="https://wiki.spiralknights.com/Red_Roarmulus_Twins" target="_blank">Red Roarmulus Twins</a> utilize <a href="https://wiki.spiralknights.com/Flame_Soul" target="_blank">flame souls</a>, as a fiery counterparts to shock. And yet, the suggestion gremlins use flame souls is confirmed by alchemy and description of <a href="https://wiki.spiralknights.com/Combuster" target="_blank">Combuster</a>: `Combining the principles of the Skylark's engines with the technology powering the Blast Furnace produced this brutal blade, which can ignite even the most flame-retardant materials at a distance`. We can identify the technology powering Blast Furnaces through the analysis of the rest of alchemy line of Combuster: `An upgraded Brandish infused with the elemental essence of fire` (<a href="https://wiki.spiralknights.com/Fireburst_Brandish" target="_blank">Fireburst Brandish</a>). The only material which is added to this 3-star blade, compared to 2-star <a href="https://wiki.spiralknights.com/Brandish" target="_blank">Brandish</a>, is <a href="https://wiki.spiralknights.com/Torchstone" target="_blank">Torchstone</a>: `A small rock that smolders constantly. Gremlins patrolling the Cooling Chambers occasionally use them as a hand warmer`. We can guess that it is a magic-infused material, due to its description. It is also the one material used to transmute <a href="https://wiki.spiralknights.com/Blazebreak_Shield" target="_blank">Blazebreak Shield</a>. <a href="https://wiki.spiralknights.com/Blazebreak_Shield" target="_blank">Blazebreak Shield</a> and <a href="https://wiki.spiralknights.com/Blizzbreaker_Shield" target="_blank">Blizzbreak Shield</a> are the only shield with visible patterns as of breakable battlepod hexagonal shields. Battlepod's shield are notably pink, which, through the color scheme of the prior 2 transmutable shields, the way we see it, highly suggests being made with usage of dark matter, as fiery variant is orange, as frost variant is light-blue.

As <a href="https://wiki.spiralknights.com/Torchstone" target="_blank">Torchstone</a> is used to transmute <a href="https://wiki.spiralknights.com/Blazebreak_Shield" target="_blank">Blazebreak Shield</a>, so <a href="https://wiki.spiralknights.com/Hailstone" target="_blank">Hailstone</a> is used for <a href="https://wiki.spiralknights.com/Blizzbreaker_Shield" target="_blank">Blizzbreak Shield</a>. This stone, same as its fiery counterpart, contains elemental energy, as suggested by the description of <a href="https://wiki.spiralknights.com/Iceburst_Brandish" target="_blank">Iceburst Brandish</a>: `An upgraded Brandish infused with the elemental essence of ice`, - a 3-star upgrade to 2-star <a href="https://wiki.spiralknights.com/Brandish" target="_blank">Brandish</a>. Followed by it 4-star upgrade - <a href="https://wiki.spiralknights.com/Blizzbrand" target="_blank">Blizzbrand</a> is described as `A high-tech blade that fuses Spiral and Clockwork Technology. It can produce a concentrated low-temperature explosion that is harmless to knights` (<a href="https://wiki.spiralknights.com/Blizzbrand" target="_blank">Blizzbrand</a>), which is now a copy-paste pattern for brandishes, which is evident by the material in question - <a href="https://wiki.spiralknights.com/Perfect_Snowball" target="_blank">Perfect_Snowball</a>. Although we can argue, as it is also acquired for 10 <a href="https://wiki.spiralknights.com/Primal_Spark#Treasure_Box_Tokens" target="_blank">primal sparks</a>, it a magical material, but definitely not a Clockwork Technology, unless such items as <a href="https://wiki.spiralknights.com/Triglav" target="_blank">Triglav</a> were made within Clockworks.

The 5-star upgrade of 4-star <a href="https://wiki.spiralknights.com/Blizzbrand" target="_blank">Blizzbrand</a> is <a href="https://wiki.spiralknights.com/Glacius" target="_blank">Glacius</a>: `Mixing some advanced theories on cryogenics with the technology powering the Cooling Chamber produced this advanced armament, which is capable of flash-freezing the most formidable of foes`. New 5-star material is <a href="https://wiki.spiralknights.com/Everfrost" target="_blank">Everfrost</a>. The description of the blade `capable of flash-freezing the most formidable of foes` matches now known powers of everfrost.

Backing to <a href="https://wiki.spiralknights.com/Blazebreak_Shield" target="_blank">Blazebreak Shield</a> and <a href="https://wiki.spiralknights.com/Blizzbreaker_Shield" target="_blank">Blizzbreak Shield</a>, <a href="https://wiki.spiralknights.com/Surge_Breaker_Shield" target="_blank">Surge Breaker Shield</a> introduces a greater importance of shock status within gremlin technology. It is transmuted through introduction of <a href="https://wiki.spiralknights.com/Volt_Oil" target="_blank">Volt Oil</a>: `A slippery substance that always holds a slight electrical charge`. Rather than being of gremlins' invention, Volt Oil is suggested to be Spiral Technology, in the description of <a href="https://wiki.spiralknights.com/Kilowatt_Pulsar" target="_blank">Kilowatt Pulsar</a>: `A Pulsar upgraded with Spiral technology to deliver an unpleasant shock on impact. Pulsar shots become more powerful the further they travel`. But, it is still elemental essence of lightning, as 3-star <a href="https://wiki.spiralknights.com/Shockburst_Brandish" target="_blank">Shockburst Brandish</a> describes addition of Volt Oil: `An upgraded Brandish infused with the elemental essence of lightning`. A 4-star upgrade, <a href="https://wiki.spiralknights.com/Boltbrand" target="_blank">Boltbrand</a>, introduces <a href="https://wiki.spiralknights.com/Thunderball" target="_blank">Thunderball</a>: `An orb of pure electricity that is typically found at the bottom of the sea of all places`. Here we also can guess that this material was initially identified by Spiral Order due to <a href="https://wiki.spiralknights.com/Plasma_Capacitor" target="_blank">Plasma Capacitor</a>: `The addition of an advanced Spiral power source gives this bomb a shockingly large blast radius`, as it is a 4-star upgrade of <a href="https://wiki.spiralknights.com/Lightning_Capacitor" target="_blank">Lightning Capacitor</a>. Despite it, the technology of large, bomb-like capacitors belongs to gremlins - <a href="https://wiki.spiralknights.com/Static_Capacitor" target="_blank">Static Capacitor</a>: `An explosive device of Gremlin origin designed to produce a deadly field of electricity`. Within this context usage of <a href="https://wiki.spiralknights.com/Thunderball" target="_blank">Thunderball</a> in <a href="https://wiki.spiralknights.com/Electron_Bomb" target="_blank">Electron Bomb</a> - `Adapted from several unconventional Gremlin theories on physics, anyone unlucky enough to be dragged into this bomb's blast is in for a shock` - likely suggests its recreation through usage of the Isorian electric material.

Regarding <a href="https://wiki.spiralknights.com/Pulsar" target="_blank">Pulsars</a>, most of their instances within the alchemy tree stem from Spiral Order research, as gremlins rarely mentioned. Yet, the original 2-star <a href="https://wiki.spiralknights.com/Pulsar" target="_blank">Pulsar</a> is described as gremlin technology: `A high-tech Gremlin firearm originally designed for use by elite squads of Ironclaw soldiers` (<a href="https://wiki.spiralknights.com/Pulsar" target="_blank">Pulsar</a>).

Herein, <a href="https://wiki.spiralknights.com/Catalyzer" target="_blank">Catalyzers</a> contain seemingly the same underlying technology, judging by design of both weapon itself and its projectiles: `An advanced alchemical armament adapted from Gremlin mining and demolition devices. Catalyzer bullets envelop the enemy in an energy field that explodes after taking damage` (<a href="https://wiki.spiralknights.com/Catalyzer" target="_blank">Catalyzer</a>). Due to its projectiles looking essentially as moonstone versions of dark matter-themed Seerus's <a href="https://wiki.spiralknights.com/Dark_Retribution" target="_blank">Dark Retribution</a>, we can confidently relate them to a single nature. its also here we revisit <a href="https://wiki.spiralknights.com/Electron_Bomb" target="_blank">Electron Bomb</a> due to a similar pattern of orbiting sphere, although here they are not glowing nor pulsing - yet, as we have concluded it being of gremlin origin, this design pattern fits well with the established theme. Due to them using potentially essences, nd the fact Dark Retribution and Arkus hold the same type of projectiles, we suggest that those are connected by the supernatural nature and stem from a common nature of energy and souls.

As for rest of bombs, paralleling <a href="https://wiki.spiralknights.com/Static_Capacitor" target="_blank">Static Capacitor</a>, those are all invented by Spiral Order, as all are described as alchemical bombs: <a href="https://wiki.spiralknights.com/Shivermist_Buster" target="_blank">Shivermist Buster</a>, <a href="https://wiki.spiralknights.com/Venom_Veiler" target="_blank">Venom Veiler</a>, <a href="https://wiki.spiralknights.com/Torpor_Tantrum" target="_blank">Torpor Tantrum</a>, <a href="https://wiki.spiralknights.com/Shivermist_Buster" target="_blank">Shivermist Buster</a>, <a href="https://wiki.spiralknights.com/Ash_of_Agni" target="_blank">Ash of Agni</a>, <a href="https://wiki.spiralknights.com/Stagger_Storm" target="_blank">Stagger Storm</a>: `Though it was originally developed by the Spiral Order to harmlessly subdue dangerous species, how you deal with foes unfortunate enough to be caught in the storm is entirely up to you` <a href="https://wiki.spiralknights.com/Ash_of_Agni" target="_blank">Ash of Agni</a> in that context seems to be a real-world Hindu deity adapted into Isorian folklore.

The rest of catalyzer-derived weaponry includes toxic, yet radioactive, <a href="https://wiki.spiralknights.com/Toxic_Catalyzer" target="_blank">Toxic Catalyzer</a>: `A Catalyzer modified to fire dangerously radioactive projectiles. Catalyzer bullets envelop the enemy in an energy field that explodes after taking damage` and unmodified, less safe and less stable <a href="https://wiki.spiralknights.com/Volatile_Catalyzer" target="_blank">Volatile Catalyzer</a>: `Removing the safety overrides from a piece of Gremlin technology is a good way to lose a limb` seem to suggest that the original catalyzer is designed as gremlins intended, rather than being a Spiral Order modification. It is also here must be noted the extent of Spiral Order engineering, utmost demonstrated by <a href="https://wiki.spiralknights.com/Virulent_Catalyzer" target="_blank">Virulent Catalyzer</a>: `The incorporation of Spiral technology has given this harrowing handgun a powerfully poisonous payload`. That is with the consideration of this gun being also radioactive.

To address the second part of this section - <a href="https://tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/Magitek" target="_blank">Magitek</a>, - based on all of those uses of magic, elemental, materials, we can make a conclusion, that gremlin indeed utilized most of known physics for the construction of Clockworks. It is the definition of the concept of Magitek, although one dependent on the definition of magic in the concrete fiction. As for the cosmology of Spiral Knights, its vagueness in some of its aspects, this seems as a definitive, application of this concept, without presence of most discrete and concrete laws of the Universe, especially, its other realms.

In order to maintain Clockworks, several complexes are built across it:

- Blast furnaces of clockworks are built and used to melt raw planetary mass. It was built with the usage of <a href="https://wiki.spiralknights.com/Flame_Soul" target="_blank">Flame Souls</a>.
- Cooling Chamber to maintain Power Complexes across the Clockworks
- Power Complexes used to wire adn distribute the energy of the Core across the Clockworks and to the surface.
- Wasteworks were collecting residue from smelting and operation of Clockworks as well as the Great Colony.

##### Undead Dreadnoughts

A side note on electricity here also must be made - as <a href="https://wiki.spiralknights.com/Static_Deadnaught#Static_Deadnaught" target="_blank">Static Dreadnoughts</a> and <a href="https://wiki.spiralknights.com/Frankenzom#Frankenzom" target="_blank">Frankenzoms</a> seem to be manufactured entities. As for the latter is seems more of a gimmick, the dreadnought raises a question. As we have covered in the context of Graveyards, only Carnavons and Slug Walkers have a distinct armor, reminiscent of Almire. Frankenzoms have a design of augmentations, seen as shoulder pads and wires pathways on the chest and spine, as well as bolts on the head. All <a href="https://wiki.spiralknights.com/Surging_Bombie#Bombie" target="_blank">Bombies</a> have a familiar 3-dot shape, suggesting that they were experimented upon, potentially of the same Iron Hulk, as it is most supernatural of all places relating to shock, even compared to the Power Complexes. Finally, <a href="https://wiki.spiralknights.com/Static_Deadnaught#Static_Deadnaught" target="_blank">Static Dreadnoughts</a> have unique design of shoulder pads and arm guards, as they have single, highly futuristic design. This could be the reason for the containment of Dry Docks, as a valuable asset for the production of shock-infused undead, which should not be too alien to gremlins, as they are involved with devilites.

So, all Dreadnoughts have an armor, apart from the Almirian Guards, which have proper crusader armor. While this factor, we believe, contributes to the nature of zombies as Isorians, and Carnavons belonging to Almire, Dreadnoughts remain. Here we will look into the design of resurrection by grim totems - as it is required for zombies' head only to remain in order to be resurrected.

We suggest, that the reason behind existence of dreadnoughts is two-fold:

- Being heavy infantry of Almire, a parallel to the setting of Warhammer 40k can be drawn, wherein cuh units of Astartees were called <a href="https://warhammer40k.fandom.com/wiki/Dreadnought" target="_blank">Dreadnoughts</a>
- An application of an pop-cultural concept and a spirit of Japanese mythology - <a href="https://yokai.com/gashadokuro/" target="_blank">Gashadokuro</a>. The key element here is the ability to assemble themselves from the bones of improperly buried, which is fitting for Almire, as well as the general theme of spirits returning to the material realm. As for their armor, we suggest it being of the same phenomenon as Lord Vanaduke's armor, of supernatural origin. We can also male a guess, that the fact dreadnoughts are presented in front of tiles of bones in the Overgrown Court of Shadowplay, we can link those two.

Those two factors, we believe, can explain their nature.

##### Alchemy

As it was stated earlier, electricity seems to be regarded as one of more important aspects of Clockworks' design, up to the point of its presence as lightnings above the Core at depth 29, and within the Unknown Passage, wherein same arcs of lightning are now integrated with the nature of the Swarm. Lightnings and abundance of power is predominantly focused within Power Complex-type Clockwork tunnels.

Power Complexes are populated by shock-themed enemies, including quicksilver lichens. Quicksilver in alchemy was often associated with the concept of the Prima Materia, and represented the soul. The dual nature of mercury, whish is essentially quicksilver, - both a liquid metal and a toxic substance, - contributed to its symbolism in alchemy, representing both transformation and danger. This points us to further presence of dualities within Clockworks. Alchemists of western cultures sought to understand and manipulate these transformative properties in their quest for the philosopher's stone and the secrets of creation of matter and achieving immortality.

Following this idea of alchemical symbolism and prior knowledge of magitek, we can make an educated guess on the nature of Energy. As we have proposed, Energy is derived from the Nameless Realm and energy was associated with the concept of salt through its symbolism.

Salt, in alchemy, in one of its many interpretation, is one of three primes. Essentially, it is one of elements from which all of matter is built. Yet, the more prominent ide of energy as omnipresent in its different forms relates to a different concept in alchemy of Prime Matter.

Here we should note on the alchemy station across Cradle and Clockworks. Their design is of Clockworks rather than of Spiral Order. We have previously proposed, that the concept of energy and later of Spiral is a universal constant. This way we explained seemingly unrelated presence of energy - or salt - symbol on both Isorian and Valkyrian armors. Through the identification of Forgotten time, we have suggested a deeper relation between Isorians and celestial beings, which could've been Owlites in heavenly kingdom, their sharing of technology and designs.

Then there was symbol of orbs of alchemy. As it is depicted on modern alchemy station and tomes of rage, descending from valkyries to a time of existing dragons, we suspect it being a universal phenomenon of matter. Then there is Sanctuary Alchemy Station, which explicitly shows this symbol.

Orb os Alchemy are philosopher's stones, as they are the catalyst for the transmutation itself. But, their origins remains unknown, as they are uncraftable. Here, we have to look at their design, one of the same as Cradle, being contained in a golden frame. The interior of alchemy orbs is of bright lights, whose amount increases depending on the rarity of the orb. This theme of gold as a compound and lights we will keep in mind until the [Orbs of Alchemy section](#orbs-of-alchemy).

##### The Prima Materia

We continue with the alchemical symbolism of the Energy, being the prime matter, first matter, the Prima Materia.

Here we will quote english translation of Carl Jung's "Psychology and Alchemy" as it is paramount to everything below and around depth 29 of Clockworks.

`The basis of the opus, the prima materia, is one of the most famous secrets of alchemy. This is hardly surprising, since it represents the unknown substance that carries the projection of the autonomous psychic content. It was of course impossible to specify such a substance, because the projection emanates from the individual and is consequently different in each case. For this reason it is incorrect to maintain that the alchemists never said what the prima materia was; on the contrary, they gave all too many definitions and so were everlastingly contradicting themselves. For one alchemist the prima materia was quicksilver, for others it was ore, iron, gold, lead, salt, sulphur, vinegar, water, air, fire, earth, blood, water of life, lapis, poison, spirit, cloud, sky, dew, shadow, sea, mother, moon, dragon, Venus, chaos, microcosm.`

`Besides these half chemical, half mythological definitions there are also some “philosophical” ones which have a deeper meaning. Thus in the treatise of Komarios we find the definition “Hades.” In Olympiodorus the black earth contains the “accursed of God” (θεοκατάρατος). The “Consilium coniugii” says that the father of gold and silver—i.e., their prima materia—is “the animal of earth and sea,” or “man,” or a “part of man,” e.g., his hair, blood, etc.`

`The unfettered opposites in chaos. “Chaos” is one of the names for the prima materia. The mercurial dragon of Greek alchemy, surnamed ἕν τò πᾶν gave rise to descriptions of the prima materia as Unum, Unica Res, and Monad and to the statement in the “Liber Platonis quartorum” that man is well qualified to complete the work because he possesses that which is simple, i.e., the soul. Mylius describes the prima materia as the elementum primordiale. It is the “pure subject and the unity of forms,” and in it any form whatsoever may be assumed (in quo retinetur quaelibet forma cum possibilitate).`

`The autonomy and everlastingness of the prima materia in Paracelsus suggest a principle equal to the Deity, corresponding to a dea mater.`

`[It] clearly show that the alchemists came to project even the highest value—God—into matter. With the highest value thus safely embedded in matter, a starting-point was given for the development of genuine chemistry on the one hand and of the more recent philosophical materialism on the other, with all the psychological consequences that necessarily ensue when the picture of the world is shifted 180 degrees. However remote alchemy may seem to us today, we should not underestimate its cultural importance for the Middle Ages. Today is the child of the Middle Ages and it cannot disown its parents.`

`The prima materia has the quality of ubiquity: it can be found always and everywhere, which is to say that projection can take place always and everywhere. The English alchemist Sir George Ripley (c. 1415–90) writes: “The philosophers tell the inquirer that birds and fishes bring us the lapis, every man has it, it is in every place, in you, in me, in everything, in time and space.” “It offers itself in lowly form [vili figura]. From it there springs our eternal water [aqua permanens].” According to Ripley the prima materia is water; it is the material principle of all bodies, including mercury. It is the hyle which the divine act of creation brought forth from the chaos as a dark sphere. The chaos is a massa confusa that gives birth to the stone. The hylical water contains a hidden elemental fire. In the treatise “De sulphure” hell-fire (ignis gehennalis) is attributed to the element earth as its inner opposite. According to Hortulanus, the stone arises from a massa confusa containing in itself all the elements. Just as the world came forth from a chaos confusum, so does the stone.`

`The idea of the rotating aquasphere reminds us of the Neopythagoreans: in Archytas the world-soul is a circle or sphere; in Philolaos it draws the world round with it in its rotation. The original idea is to be found in Anaxagoras, where the nous gives rise to a whirlpool in chaos. The cosmogony of Empedokles is also relevant: here the σϕαīρος (spherical being) springs from the union of dissimilars, owing to the influence of ϕιλία. The definition of this spherical being as, “the most serene God,” sheds a special light on the perfect, “round” nature of the lapis, which arises from, and constitutes, the primal sphere; hence the prima materia is often called lapis. The initial state is the hidden state, but by the art and the grace of God it can be transmuted into the second, manifest state. That is why the prima materia sometimes coincides with the idea of the initial stage of the process, the nigredo. It is then the black earth in which the gold or the lapis is sown like the grain of wheat. It is the black, magically fecund earth that Adam took with him from Paradise, also called antimony and described as a “black blacker than black” (nigrum nigrius nigro).`

From here stems the idea of Mercurius, standing on the round chaos, holding the scales which signify the pondus et mensura. The rotundum is a prefiguration of the gold.

Known as the alchemical Void, the Prima Materia, at its base form being the Void, and Energy, one which is present in everything across material realm, as shown by Sparks of Life and <a href="https://wiki.spiralknights.com/Silkwing#Silkwing" target="_blank">Silkwing healing powers</a>. Concentration of raw energy drastically amplifies vitality of everything that it surrounds, as evident by the Core's influence, up to if not limited to the transformation of battle sprites. Those alchemical concepts should be kept in mind, as a few elements of gremlin society remain.

##### King Tinkinzar

`The Nine are blind, they cannot see the Truth that lies below. The Nine are deaf, they cannot hear the Resonance that beats within this world` (<a href="https://wiki.spiralknights.com/Danger_Module:_Hidden_Hideout" target="_blank">Spark and Roar - Hidden Hideout - Danger Module - Herex</a>) is inversion of what seemingly Seerus says in the Engines of War: `The Nine see all, hear all` and `King Tinkinzar alone upholds the Iron Law!`

Those phrases are found at the monitors with the imagery of Crimson Order symbol. This design pattern, as well as the [previous analysis](#great-colony-and-iron-law) of Iron Law, is reminiscent of Big Brother and his quotes, depicted on the telescreens.

As it was previously pointed out: `Tinkinzar is said to be a great ruler and mechanical genius, responsible for the vision of the whole Clockworks` (<a href="https://wiki.spiralknights.com/Bootshuze" target="_blank">Bootshuze</a>) - it frames Tinkinzar as an embodiment of a particular trope - <a href="https://tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ThePhilosopherKing" target="_blank">the philosopher king</a>, a scientist-king, and here, implied creator of Clockworks.

These similarities, as well as the implied longevity and general benevolence of king Tinkinzar in contrast with the realities of gremlin civilization lead us to the conclusion of concept of a great gremlin king being engineered specifically by Crimson Order.

We would have concluded at that, if not for the existence of the Architect:

`IN HIS MADNESS, THE ARCHITECT BETRAYED THE PACT. TWISTING HIS CREATION INTO A GAME OF DEATH, IT NOW DEVOURS ALL WHO ENTER ITS IRON EMBRACE.` ([Echo Stone: Ironclaw Munitions Factory](https://wiki.spiralknights.com/Artifact)).

Due to total absence of any entity remotely reminiscent of the Architect, apart from abstraction of the Swarm, the single and only lead we see - Architect is king Tinkinzar. More similarities arise from notes of the Alpha Squad, framing Clockworks in the similar manner: `This is a world designed to confuse its travelers. It wants to trap and destroy them. I'm starting to think its like a cat, toying with its prey before delivering the final blow` ([Recon Module: Ironclaw Munitions Factory - Rulen](https://wiki.spiralknights.com/Artifact)).

With this in mind, with the idea of Great Colony, and Iron Law, we can attempt to guess the logic behind the Artifact, its role.

##### Divine and Whitespace Clockworks

The Artifact and Consoles are connected by the fact of working as a key and a lock. Yet, to understand this relation and its precise effects, we are required to be aware of the designs of Whitespace, of what distinguishes it from the rest of depths in detail. We will perform this analysis in multiple iterations, looking as the specific elements.

First, 3 new concepts are introduced by Whitespace, one that is most certainly located within the Core during the events of <a href="https://wiki.spiralknights.com/Dreams_and_nightmares" target="_blank">Dreams and Nightmares</a>:

- Existence of Whitespace Clockwork tunnels at the start of the <a href="https://wiki.spiralknights.com/Dreams_and_Nightmares/A_Step_Beyond" target="_blank">Step Beyond</a>, a platform, reminiscent of the beginning of the <a href="https://wiki.spiralknights.com/Unknown_Passage" target="_blank">Unknown Passage</a>:

  - Both platform have similar proportions: 9 tiles width, and 9 tiles depth, whitespace version has 10 tiles depth.
  - Both versions have 4x4 4 Clockworks tunnel pillars on each angle of the main platform.
  - Through the border of the platform goes a single pipe.
  - But, Unknown passage platform has 3 paths extending from it, white Whitespace has only a single path obscured by the different material.

- Transition from the design of Clockwork tunnels to an abstract shapes of cubes of Whitespace proper.
  - It partially reminds of the design choice present in the Unknown Passage, as portion of the tunnel was destroyed, Whitespace forms - the cubes - filled it in order for knight to pass over the gap.

White Clockwork tunnels are seen only once outside of the Core - in the [Divine theme](<https://wiki.spiralknights.com/Theme_(Guild_Hall)>) of the Guild Hall. It is the last and most expensive upgrade, requiring most of the wings of the Hall being unlocked and active. This connection establishes a relation between Divine color scheme due to the naming convention and nature of Whitespace. For the most part, divine-themed equipment is related to heavenly kingdom. But the difference here arises from the particular colors, as monochrome of Whitespace is not attributed to the divine color scheme. A more fitting connection through monochromatic pattern is attributed to the <a href="https://wiki.spiralknights.com/Grey_Prize_Box" target="_blank">Grey Prise Box</a>.

Grey prize box contains replicas of every accessory, but also battle sprites. This pattern is similar to the white Clockworks in the Core, with an addition of darkened <a href="https://wiki.spiralknights.com/Grey_Aura#Grey_Aura" target="_blank">grey aura</a>. We have the explanation behind this design, but it requires understanding role of the Swarm first, which will be discussed soon.

One more element of the grey prize box in particular is the <a href="https://wiki.spiralknights.com/Silver_Personal_Color#Silver_Personal_Color" target="_blank">silver personal color</a>, as silver is the heavenly metal within this cosmology - as <a href="https://wiki.spiralknights.com/Sun_Silver" target="_blank">Sun Silver</a>, and the <a href="https://wiki.spiralknights.com/Celestial_Ore" target="_blank">Celestial Ore</a>, relating back to the celestials, supposed Owlites. A less important note is the pure grey design of non-prismatic elements of <a href="https://wiki.spiralknights.com/Heavenly_Iron_Helm" target="_blank">Heavenly iron Helm</a> which is transmuted with the introduction of the <a href="https://wiki.spiralknights.com/Celestial_Ore" target="_blank">Celestial Ore</a>.

The third design concept found in Whitespace is of square spiral. As in case of the [first introduction](#concept-of-spiral) of this form, we are searching for patterns:

- Walkways of the Step Beyond depths have transitory square spiral patterns.
- Patterns of square spirals present on the gates - enemy gates and golden key gates.

  The prior, notably, has image of an eye with significantly larger iris and pinkish purple color, reminiscent of curse more than Swarm's pink.

- Square spiral pattern is also observed across <a href="https://wiki.spiralknights.com/The_Artifact" target="_blank">Mysterious Consoles and the Artifact</a>. It will be the point of the further analysis.

There are 3 main elements to the console itself: the display, a platform, and a slot for the Artifact.

The notable element of the console, which, we believe, is a solid proof of Console's gremlin origin, is the design of the console below the display. It is a curved structure of metal with internal components of dark metal and external plating of more bright color. And exactly on the latter, on each side of the console, there are 3-stub ends placed in a radial shape with a circled hole below. It is the exact design of the Clockwork elevators - each side of which contains that exact design up to the inner and outer plating. Except for the color of the outer plating is more contrast. There are brass component sof the grid floor of the console, which hold the wires. Color of those elements is the same as the component of the same design around the moving Clockwork elevators' platform.

Ironwork-like designs on the outer and inner circles of the console's platform surrounding the grid and the pattern the Artifact's lid are similar to the Greek key - a part of the meander pattern. As both contain spiral or spiral-like patterns of right angles used as decorative component of the architecture, Greek architecture.

The meaning of this meander patter is usually accepted as movement of water or cyclical and moving nature of life. It also has associations with labyrinths or mazes. The labyrinth has
symbolic associations of fertility, birth, and death.

Due to utmost proximity of this Clockwork design to the Whitespace, we can gather that this design has greater importance to gremlin civilization, or at least, its inner party, such as Crimson Order, as nowhere else any symbolic element is present apart of Crimson Order insignia itself or the gremlin emblem.

The last components of the console are the display itself and slot for the artifact. While there is not much, currently, in regards to the slot Artifact is placed in, the display as wel las the Artifact's lid contain symbols, which we identify as gremlin written language.

##### Gremlin Conlang

Based on the encountered instances of gremlin written language, or rather their written system, we will use for the description of those symbol w in this document <a href="https://symbl.cc/en/unicode/blocks/block-elements/" target="_blank">unicode block symbols</a>. Those symbol are encountered in 3 instances - Console with the Artifact, and Roarmulus Twins.

The important thing is to establish is how to transcribe them, - does the dark element of the square fill the letter, or it is the white form we are looking for? To solve this, e have to look at physical letters. One such instance is on the side of the lid, covering the Artifact during activation - those symbols, judging by the lightning, are located in front of the darker elements. We consider this as the guide.

Then there is the direction in which those symbols are read. As console screen depicts rows as, likely, notations to the pulse flow from left to right, we can guess that the gremlin conlang is written horizontally from left to right. But the instance of the console screen does not tell of what are the symbols there - as we can consider the white squared as background, or as part of letters. To solve it, we appeal to the earlier case of symbols on the inner plate layer of the lid of the Artifact clot container, as there, there would be no need to carve with such intricacy the individual blocks.

- This, we believe, leads us to interpret the white background as if the color is inverted, meaning that the patter of the symbol is black.
- The same logic is then applied to the row of 3 symbol on the container's lid - reading there only black patterns.
- On the other inner metal plate on the horizontal dimension of the lid we look for white pattern on black background.
- The Roarmulus Twins' symbols are the black patterns

<div class="code-conlang">

As a result, we get the following symbols:

- Console
  - console screen
    - Leftmost section
      - `▝` `▄` - a pulse line extends from this row
      - `▄` `▘` `▟`
      - `▞` `▗` `▌` - a pulse line extends from this row
      - `▟` `▝` `▗` `▝`
      - `▀` `▄` `▘` - a pulse line extends from this row
    - Pulse line annotations
      - `▝` `▚` `█` `_` `▛`
      - `▘` `▟` `▘` `▄` `▌`
      - `█` `▗` `▀` `▙` `▝` - positioned above rightmost pulse line
    - Rightmost section
      - `▗` `▀` `▄`
      - `▖` `▟` `▌`
      - `▐` `▞` `█`
  - Artifact Container Lid
    - `▗` `▀` `▙` - side of the lid, engraved on the outer metal plate layer
    - `█` `_` `▛` `▗` `▀` - Side of the lid is mirrored on both sides retaining its orientation. This means, that one of the readings - a side upon which it is read, is incorrect. Since the previous line is not symmetrically places, we will consider this orientation as correct.
    - The last text is on top of the lid, and it is as large as the console screen text. In fact, it is the same image, all of the lines from the console screen are appended to the leftmost block's last line.
- Artifact

  All of its 3 circles have the same pattern. We will looks for the black symbols on light background.

  `x` - marks lack of circle's surface

  `_` - marks lack of light on the surface

  The result is: `x` `▀` `x` `▐` `▞` `█` `▗` `x` `x` `▟` `x` `▖` `_` `▌` `▄` `x`

- Roarmulus Twins

  - Marking pointing to the right eye and the foundation with an arrow: `▀`

    Due to lack of space above the block, we can conclude that is only symbol possible to fit. And, due to to presence of a next line on the armor plate, we will read it in the same direction.

  - Arrows pointing to armor plates' joints: `_` `▀` `▟` `█` `▌` `▌`

    There are several issues with this transcription:

    - The last 2 repeating symbol is an uncommon pattern.
    - We can gather, that the `█` is incorrect, which will lead th followed symbols to be interpreted incorrectly. There is a possibility of `▐` being present.
    - But the one to last symbol has vertical side with a pit, followed to the left exactly as the width of `▌`, leaving the questionable symbol on the left as one similar to triangle. No such symbol is seen anywhere else.
    - The last symbol, due to lack of boxes, could be as `▌` as `▐`. So, due to this, we have to operate on those symbol with a possibility of error inherited in the transcription.

    This line is found in multiple instances, always pointing to a point of 2 plates connecting, which might five a hint to its meaning.

  Notably, the texture of the Roarmulus Blueprints has all metal notches depicted as on the Twins themselves.

Based on this, we can arrange a table of repetitions of each symbol:

<center>

|                 Symbol                  | Amount of times encountered |
| :-------------------------------------: | :-------------------------: |
|                   `▖`                   |              2              |
|                   `▗`                   |              7              |
|                   `▘`                   |              4              |
|                   `▝`                   |              5              |

|                   `▄`                   |              6              |
|                   `▀`                   |              6              |
|                   `█`                   |           5 / 6?            |
|                   `▙`                   |              2              |
|                   `▟`                   |              4              |
|                   `▚`                   |              1              |
|                   `▞`                   |              3              |

|                   `▛`                   |              2              |
| `_` (space or an empty outlined square) |           3 / 4?            |

</center>

</div>

Mention of gremlin cryptography in the Aftermath (`` - []()) may be related to this language. But the presented instances of the language, we believe, are now encrypted, as in case of Roarmulus twins, they served as markings on the joint of armor plates, and in case of Mysterious Console and Artifact, they seem to be instructions, as they are present both on top of the lid and in the holographic display, serving functional purpose, especially in the context of anything relation to the Core, or its hatch at depth 29.

There are also gremlin schematics, recovered from Crimson Order Complex 357 by Herex prior to his departure to the Throne Room of Firestorm Citadel. The schematics in that regard could relate to anything within the Core or simply to constructs. Our concern is of the nature of those schematics. There were ancient tomes present in the very end of the complex 357, and, considering prior analysis of gremlin technology, it could be anything related to Owlites, as far as tomes' design goes and their usage of elementals for the operation of Clockworks.

There are also instances of gremlin language, most of the time it is transcribed fluently, but in one instance - <a href="https://wiki.spiralknights.com/Breaking_in_the_Recruits/Operation_Greenhorn" target="_blank">Operation Greenhorn</a>. In the strangers' town, gremlins have a different pattern of speaking: `Greetings, little. One. Don't step. On snipes`, `Greetings. Get Shinies. Get Shinies`, `Snipes. Buy? Sell?` (<a href="https://wiki.spiralknights.com/Breaking_in_the_Recruits/Operation_Greenhorn" target="_blank">Strangers</a>).

As far as we have researched, we are unable to decipher the written form of the language. That is if it is an instance of a completed language. And, considering that most of this symbols would not be looked at, it is likely an unfinished form.

##### Artifact, Console, and a Hatch

Consoles contain the designs and patterns of square spiral or a Greek key, found within the Whitespace of the Core on the gates and across tile arrangements of the depths.

It is believed that combination of the Artifact and console is capable of opening the Core, but, we found several inconsistencies. The terms generator and Artifact will be used interchangeably.

Ancient <a href="https://wiki.spiralknights.com/The_Artifact" target="_blank">Generator</a> can contain some amount of energy, as evident by Herex and Razwog dialogue, as Razwog was tasked to find a way to power the Generator: `Schemer Razwog: Work away from the others. The Order must never know we have the artifact. Find a way to power it. Bring it to me. Do not betray me. I will know` <a href="https://wiki.spiralknights.com/Crossing_the_Chasm/The_Journey_to_Haven" target="_blank">Crossing the Chasm - The Journey to Haven - Herex</a> and `Too late again! I have already collected the power I need to use the Artifact and nothing you can do now will stop what I have set in motion` (<a href="https://wiki.spiralknights.com/Shadowplay/Throne_Room" target="_blank">Shadowplay - Throne Room - Herex</a>).

The generator is located in the Power Complex-<a href="https://wiki.spiralknights.com/File:Area-The_Ancient_Generator-Restoring_Power.png" target="_blank">like</a> facility, with wires <a href="https://wiki.spiralknights.com/File:TheArtifact-FirstSight.png" target="_blank">going up into the platform with the Artifact</a>. Notably, both wires of the activated console and wires found all across Cradle have the same animation of being powered, as pulse of light travels across them. This design is similar to the pulse lines found in the holographic screen of an active console. It is there both Cradle, its Moon, and Cradle's gimbal ring. We will return to the gimbal ring later. Active console's pulse is much higher. The intense light of an Artifact placed into the slot and connected to the console is similar to the light of the Core's shell plate seals, although lacking steam. Below the active console bolts of lightning are seem - that is another connection between role of Power Complexes and Clockworks.

Then there is a quote regarding this power complex: `Our scans have located an ancient generator below this camp. It should be sending power to the surface, but something seems to be diverting it. We need you to go investigate the ancient generator and divert power back to the surface` (<a href="https://wiki.spiralknights.com/Greta_Dialogue/Rescue_Camp" target="_blank">Rescue Camp - Greta</a>). Greta concludes that through Razwog's facility generator should not be interfered. Yet, it is unknown weather generator was found there or was placed in order to be powered by the facility: `Schemer Razwog: Work away from the others. The Order must never know we have the artifact. Find a way to power it. Bring it to me. Do not betray me. I will know` (<a href="https://wiki.spiralknights.com/Crossing_the_Chasm/The_Journey_to_Haven" target="_blank">Crossing the Chasm - The Journey to Haven - Herex</a>). Moreover, it is stated that its power is being diverted, rerouted. To where it is rerouted, remains known. The only lead here is the quote from Feron: `The name's Feron, Lieutenant of the Spiral Order. We had believed this entire complex was derelict until the elevator leading to it suddenly surged to life. Upon investigating the whole place soon went up in a blaze!` (<a href="https://wiki.spiralknights.com/Crossing_the_Chasm/The_Journey_to_Haven" target="_blank">Crossing the Chasm - The Journey to Haven - Feron</a>), which might suggest, that the facility was inactive, and as it is located near the Razwog's complex, so the fact it was restored, could've been due to actions of knights restoring power in the Rescue Camp, or due to prolonged operation of Razwog's facility. In both instances, it seems that the generator was already powered by the time Greta had scanned the area.

The other matter is of the fact that Herex warned off Razwog: `The Order must never know we have the artifact` (<a href="https://wiki.spiralknights.com/Crossing_the_Chasm/The_Journey_to_Haven" target="_blank">Crossing the Chasm - The Journey to Haven - Herex</a>). This suggests, that:

- Artifact was not intended to be found or recovered. The prior would suggest the Artifact was located below the camp and was power the surface in order to be concealed for any other location at the surface of Cradle. The fact that power was diverted of it, could mean that it was used for a different purpose. And, if it was stollen from a different location, this would have mean that the Order in question should have known of it.
- The Order - Crimson Order, as it is the only known entity - is related to the Artifact and aware of it. The seemingly un-powered state of the Artifact is then to be desired, as it is implied to be not powered.

  This idea of Herex going against Crimson Order was explored in a few other instances:

  - `The Iron Law is Broken! The Crimson Order is False! The Nine are blind, they cannot see the Truth that lies below. The Nine are deaf, they cannot hear the Resonance that beats within this world. Herex no longer serves as one of the Nine. Only Herex sees and hears the Truth. Only Herex will prevail. Follow Herex and you will be spared` (<a href="https://wiki.spiralknights.com/Hidden_Hideout" target="_blank">Spark and Roar - Hidden Hideout - Herex</a>).
  - `Infiltrate the Complex. Take all schematics. The Nine are quite but we will silence them. The Knights persue but we will halt them. Only Herex comprehends the Truth. Only Herex will descend. There can be no other` (<a href="https://wiki.spiralknights.com/Complex_357" target="_blank">Crimson Chaos - Complex 357 - Herex</a>)

  From this, we can gather, that the intention to open the Core is one prohibited by Crimson Order.

Alpha Squad was sent into the Clockworks right after the crash landing, and most of te missions did follow the trey, they left behind in the form of Recon Modules. In the Core the last recon module is found: `We are at the end of the line. ...  And then we could go no further. As I record this, the darkness is nearly upon us, consuming the world we see, the light. But then the Core, it began to open, filling the place with such a light, such an intense, blinding light. Euclid has made the call; faced with the darkness, we'll enter the core, enter the light` ([Recon Module: Entrance to the Core - Parma](https://wiki.spiralknights.com/Recon_Module)).

The other time core was reported to open was during <a href="https://wiki.spiralknights.com/A_Call_to_Arms" target="_blank">A Call to Arms</a>: `This is Vaelyn at the Core Terminal. Team wiped out. Darkness everywhere. Send help. It is opening` (<a href="https://wiki.spiralknights.com/A_Call_to_Arms#Dialogue" target="_blank">A Call to Arms - Vaelyn</a>).

Both cases of Core opening can be eventually explained. The reanimation of the Citadel is halted seemingly due to activation of the console. yet, it is activated only by the time knight reaches the throne room. Then, there is a call from Vaelyn and only after it event of Dream and Nightmares unfold, wherein Vaelyn reinstates, that the core is opening. This can be interpreted in 2 ways: either the core opens particularly slowly, or it is a way to hammer in the point of Core opening. While the latter explanation supersedes any internal world logic, the prior does not, and, moreover can last far longer. By that we mean a possibility of knight first reaching the surface, and only then receiving an emergency call from Vaelyn.

It is also unknown, what were the contents of the previous report, which was blocked: `We were in the middle of receiving a report from Lieutenant Vaelyn's team at the Core Terminal when our signal was disrupted. It took some time, but I've managed to pinpoint the source of the disruption. its coming from that strange device you discovered near Vanaduke's throne room in Firestorm Citadel. It seems like someone has activated it. ... We don't know for sure but it has to be related to the Artifact. The energy signatures are identical` (<a href="https://wiki.spiralknights.com/The_Flickering_Flame" target="_blank">The Flickering Flame - Kora</a>). But, as it is was stated, that Spiral HQ was in the middle of receiving a report, which can be interpreted as a comlink was already established and it was a regular report, or, it was blocked prior to being received. Then, the disruption was sudden, and unexpected. It is here we are unaware of how much time has passed since Lord Vanaduke was slayed, as up to that point most of the cavern within which Firestorm Citadel is located, was extinguished. We can gather that right after Vanaduke was defeated, Vaelyn started her expedition: `I understand that Lieutenant Vaelyn has already led a team to the Core terminal and is establishing a base of operations for research.` (<a href="https://wiki.spiralknights.com/Honor_and_Duty" target="_blank">Honor and Duty - Feron</a>), and by the next mission a contact with the Core Terminal was established: `We've already established our research base and are collecting a tremendous amount of data that we would have never had without your efforts.` (<a href="https://wiki.spiralknights.com/The_Search_Continues" target="_blank">The Search Continues - Vaelyn</a>).

Based of Herex's activity, we can gather that he and his supposed "inner fold" (`All traces of Compound 42 should be eliminated, along with the facility and any engineers not part of the inner fold. Remind the scorchers who find these orders uncomfortable that those who disobey shall soon hear my whisper in their ears` - <a href="https://wiki.spiralknights.com/Compound_42/Containment" target="_blank">Compound 42 - Containment - Herex</a>) moved into the Citadel once it became safe traverse. We considered inner group mainly due to presence of gremlins in the Throne Room of Shadowplay with Herex. Here, real-time insertion of the Artifact into the console could be a hyperbolic gesture to emphasize the stakes at certain moment. Yet, we propose, this would not disregard the fact that the Core was opening particularly slowly.

We could have unlinked this activity within the console to Core opening, but, due to how narrative is posed, it is the most likely connection.

Then there is an instance of the first time Core had opened, which was witnessed by the Alpha Squad. This is the point of inconsistency:

- `we've located an energy signature similar to the one emanating from that Artifact you found in the Clockworks. We're homing in on that energy signature now. Finding the source might help us understand what that gremlin schemer Razwog planned on doing with the Artifact or what the device is actually capable of` (<a href="https://wiki.spiralknights.com/A_New_Threat/Lobby" target="_blank">A New Threat - Lobby - Kora</a>).

  Dialogue happens while the Artifact is in the Lab.

- `most of our sensor equipment seems to have been damaged. It might take some time to get things working to the point where I can track down the Artifact` (<a href="https://wiki.spiralknights.com/A_New_Threat/The_Lab" target="_blank">A New Threat - The Lab - Kora</a>).

  Dialogue happens after the Artifact was stollen.

- `I've been able to track down the source of that energy signature. Here is the bad news: the energy source has been pinpointed to a highly dangerous area of the Clockworks that Recon Knights have dubbed the 'Royal Jelly Palace.' ... The energy signature is coming from somewhere in the Royal Jelly Palace and we need you to investigate. Royal Jellies are very territorial so you might have to get past its lair in order to reach your objective` (<a href="https://wiki.spiralknights.com/Another_Trace" target="_blank">Another Trace - Kora</a>)

  Dialogue happens some time prior to invading Royal Jelly Palace.

The original location of the energy signature could not have been Royal Jelly Palace, as it would require Herex to introduce the Artifact before it was captured in the events of <a href="https://wiki.spiralknights.com/The_Ancient_Generator" target="_blank">The Ancient Generator</a>. The Artifact had to be placed into the console either after it was stollen, as the signature seem to appear only on console's activation: `It took some time, but I've managed to pinpoint the source of the disruption. its coming from that strange device you discovered near Vanaduke's throne room in Firestorm Citadel. It seems like someone has activated it` (<a href="https://wiki.spiralknights.com/The_Flickering_Flame" target="_blank">The Flickering Flame - Kora</a>). Moreover, if the disruption appears only on console's activation, then Vaelyn's message prior to <a href="https://wiki.spiralknights.com/The_Flickering_Flame" target="_blank">The Flickering Flame</a> was that emergency of Core opening.

The only solution for such chain of events with the retention of the connection of Core opening with the activation of a console is that the Artifact was used on the Royal Jelly Palace console before it was returned to Razwog, which would require either Alpha Squad to descend at rapid speed to depth 29, or that the time passing between initial crash landing, Alpha Squad departure, and the events of <a href="https://wiki.spiralknights.com/The_Ancient_Generator" target="_blank">The Ancient Generator</a> had to be much larger. The latter case is more plausible for the Alpha Squad recon modules' contents are made not in a short period of time:

- `As Spiral HQ is not yet fully operational and most systems are offline, these personal recordings will have to suffice as a record of our expedition until HQ can establish an Uplink system with squads in the field` ([Recon Module: Gloaming Wildwoods - Euclid](https://wiki.spiralknights.com/Recon_Module)).

  It relates to a time prior to Knights even reaching Haven: `We discovered a town known as 'Haven' and have set up a base of operations there. The locals have provided us with food, shelter and power. its not Isora, but its home for now. I've pinpointed your location. Unfortunately you'll need to cross a massive chasm in order to reach Haven. Perhaps now that your camp has power there is an elevator somewhere leading into the Clockworks. You may just be able to reach us that way` (<a href="https://wiki.spiralknights.com/First_Contact" target="_blank">First Contact - Kora</a>).

- `We narrowly evaded a gremlin trap today. Ambushed on a platform above a pit of molten slag, we had to hold our ground against a horde of the snarling beasts as we dodged incoming rocket fire from above. Fun stuff. Grantz took the full blast of a rocket twice, reacting only with a stagger as if he had discovered a stone in his boot. Sometimes I think that beneath his iron suit is a body of equally heavy iron. It wouldn't surprise me. Parma has been hard on herself, saying that she should have scouted the trap. But how can you scout a world that is ever in flux? How can you be sure that the path ahead is still safe if you can never be sure its still even there?` ([Recon Module: Ironclaw Munitions Factory - Rulen](https://wiki.spiralknights.com/Recon_Module)).
- `Within the Clockworks we can afford little sleep. Hostiles are around every corner and many of the environments are unsuitable for camp. But when sleep comes, I find myself dreaming more than I ever have before. In my dreams I see Cradle, slowly turning and drifting through the stars. I see the patches of its varying terrain unfold and stretch across the stars like an enormous quilt. It is an oddly comforting dream, to see a world unravel itself... But then I wake, and the chaos of the Clockworks engulfs me once more; the groans of its ever-turning cogs and howls of the terrible beasts that call it home echoing everywhere. I hope to return one day to the surface, to a sun, to a place where peace is more than a fleeting dream` ([Recon Module: The Gauntlet - Euclid](https://wiki.spiralknights.com/Recon_Module)).

Most of the entries directly refer to a fact that the expedition had lasted for multiple days. In order to keep the chronology of the events, we can suggest that the latter scenario of earlier missions lasting for a longer period of time is more plausible here. Unless, of course, there exists a possibility of the signature within the Royal Jelly Palace being a new signal. And as for the Shadowplay itself, as 2 missions relating to Vaelyn and her expedition to the Core: `I understand that Lieutenant Vaelyn has already led a team to the Core terminal and is establishing a base of operations for research.` (<a href="https://wiki.spiralknights.com/Honor_and_Duty" target="_blank">Honor and Duty - Feron</a>), `We've already established our research base and are collecting a tremendous amount of data that we would have never had without your efforts` (<a href="https://wiki.spiralknights.com/The_Search_Continues" target="_blank">The Search Continues - Vaelyn</a>), we can further suggest, that some time had to pass between missions, even with the consideration of implied Clockwork elevators' speed.

Considering that during the event of Shadowplay Artifact remains in the console, suggests that it was not intended to be taken out just yet, but was either forcefully extracted, or the console had malfunctioned, which could be a possibility considering potential Clockworks' age. But, it seems conclusive, that the moment console was activated, a captured energy signal at Royal Jelly Palace's console, was the cause for Core's hatch to open temporarily the exact moment Alpha Squad had reached the Core Terminal after passing through the Firestorm Citadel. And, as Parma had stated to be followed by the Swarm prior to Core opening, we can further suggest, that the process of opening is slower that immediate (`We are at the end of the line. Pursued by some kind of terrible darkness we are forced into the unknown. As we neared the Core- I don't know how to describe this really... the shadows came alive and began to attack us. Rulen became enveloped in it and by the time Grantz freed him his body was badly burned. He said it felt like both fire and ice. And then we could go no further. As I record this, the darkness is nearly upon us, consuming the world we see, the light. But then the Core, it began to open, filling the place with such a light, such an intense, blinding light. Euclid has made the call; faced with the darkness, we'll enter the core, enter the light` - [Recon Module: Entrance to the Core - Parma](https://wiki.spiralknights.com/Recon_Module)).

Introduction of the Artifact to the Console, paired with Herex's dialogue (`I have already collected the power I need to use the Artifact and nothing you can do now will stop what I have set in motion.` - <a href="https://wiki.spiralknights.com/Shadowplay/Throne_Room" target="_blank">Shadowplay - Throne Room - Herex</a>) suggests, that it is the reason for Core's hatch opening, but, in order to work - to open the Core, - each time Artifact had to be recharged, it was already charged during the events of <a href="https://wiki.spiralknights.com/The_Ancient_Generator" target="_blank">The Ancient Generator</a> covered earlier.

Keeping those effect in mind, we can hypothesize on presence of the Swarm during both instances of Core opening, before it had to actually open, as described by Parma, and seen during the events of <a href="https://wiki.spiralknights.com/Dreams_and_Nightmares/The_Path_is_Revealed" target="_blank">The Path is Revealed</a>. This, again, ties with a undefined duration of the entire process of Core opening, starting from the Artifact being placed into the console.

The idea of activated console preventing subduing of the curse within the Firestorm Citadel (`Though the nature sprites have been steadily making progress in fighting the flames, something or someone has recently caused a violent resurgence in its destructive power. Spiral HQ requests that you gather together a crack squad of knights and return to the collapsing ruins of Firestorm Citadel in order to discover the source of the disturbance` - <a href="https://wiki.spiralknights.com/Shadowplay" target="_blank">Shadowplay</a>), we can propose, that the underling nature of energies cycling through the console, the comlink signal, and the fiery power of curse are all related.

#### Core Terminal

Here, we should also note of the design of the Core Terminal. Based on the designs of Grand Arsenal, briefing room at Aftermath specifically, we can conclude that the monitors are also of gremlin invention, as rest of Clockworks. But, compared to all known location, and especially other Clockwork Terminals starting from the Arcade itself, it is comprised of a single platform with to walls and a walkway to the Core's hatch, while peculiar amount of monitors is irregularly stacked across the platform.

Moreover, they are shown to depict only 2 states on their screens, of a lock, and and evil eye, this time attributed to the Swarm.

We can suggest, that such placement is intentional and designed to introduce an organic aspect of Clockworks, as suggested by Vaelyn:

- `I am confident that aside from a potential energy source, the Core is a kind of nerve center for everything you see within the Clockworks. You can feel it in what little air is down here; a wild, ominous sense that this is no mere machine` (<a href="https://wiki.spiralknights.com/Vaelyn" target="_blank">Vaelyn</a>).
- `Everything about the Core suggests there are no 'doors' into it. its not a structure built to enter from the outside. Rather, it seems just the opposite. ... I don't know, but it is certainly a terrifying picture she has painted. Something stirs within the heart of this world, something terrible. I've felt it since we first set foot on this world; invisible eyes watching our every move, shapes that form just out of view... something greater than gremlins calls this world home` (<a href="https://wiki.spiralknights.com/The_Search_Continues" target="_blank">The Search Continues - Vaelyn</a>).
- `The Core that we seek, there's something truly dreadful about it. I know that it may very well be what gets us home, but I can't shake this feeling that we've been thinking about it all wrong. ... I mean that the Core isn't a big battery that runs this world, but rather it and the whole of this world is a massive prison designed to keep something from ever leaving. Think about our geo-scans of Cradle just before the crash- they show it as being composed of hundreds of massive slabs of other worlds, almost like plates of armor. Then you have the Clockworks, the most unnatural thing I've ever seen. An entire world whose sole purpose seems to be stopping anyone from ever reaching its Core` (<a href="https://wiki.spiralknights.com/Becoming_a_Champion" target="_blank">Becoming a Champion - Feron</a>).
- `This is a world designed to confuse its travelers. It wants to trap and destroy them. I'm starting to think its like a cat, toying with its prey before delivering the final blow` ([Recon Module: Ironclaw Munitions Factory - Rulen](https://wiki.spiralknights.com/Recon_Module)).

From here, we can finally begin to analyze the Swarm. First we have to return to the monitors. In the state, when the Core is Sealed, imagery of locks is blue with a 2-color blue pattern similar to gate icons behind the static. During the event of <a href="https://wiki.spiralknights.com/Dreams_and_Nightmares/The_Path_is_Revealed" target="_blank">The Path is Revealed</a>, the static overtakes the background, rendering it black, while depicting the evil eye. From here on out, we will consider appearances of the Swarm as diegetic. This alone demonstrates, that Swarm is capable of interacting with gremlin, and potentially any, technology, making itself present and aware of through this medium.

#### Shadow Lairs

Shadow Lairs are introduced in a manner ([Release Notes: 2011.10.19](https://wiki.spiralknights.com/Release_Notes_2011-10-19)), which suggest, that the entities in question are alive and Spiral Order possess knowledge on them as if their were already defeated in the past:

- `The Gloaming Wildwoods has been infected with a poisonous miasma and the Snarbolax is said to have gone rabid!`
- `The Royal Jelly Palace has frozen over and its king usurped by the true heir to the slimy throne, the frigid Ice Queen!`
- `The Ironclaw Munitions Factory has begun creating in fiery weapons and improved upon its ultimate weapon in the form of the Red Roarmulus Twins!`
- `A powerful curse has overtaken the Firestorm Citadel, transforming its hordes and lead by the mighty Darkfire Vanaduke!`

Here we will cover the rest of the locations, specifically the Wildwoods and the Citadel, and then analyze, weather they fit into an existing timeline.

##### Miasma

The miasma is described as the reason for the change within the Wildwoods: `The Gloaming Wildwoods has been infected with a poisonous miasma and the Snarbolax is said to have gone rabid!`

Yet, when Snarbolax is encountered, apart from being rabid, it is present in multiple instances. We have previously suggested, that Snarbolax is cursed, with curse accumulating in its hide, and gaining immortality, which would be the reason for its existence since the collapse of tortomega civilization.

Snarbolax was defeated by knights, unless here it was not one of its kind, as suggested by presence of multiple it instances.

This case of Rotting Metropolis creates a fitting precedent for existence of poisoned Gloaming Wildwoods and Rabid Snarbolax. It is stated that `The Gloaming Wildwoods has been infected with a poisonous miasma and the Snarbolax is said to have gone rabid!` ([Release Notes: 2011.10.09](https://wiki.spiralknights.com/Release_Notes_2011-10-19)), so, considering that all of Clockwork location can be moved, the prime example being molten cavern of Firestorm Citadel - `The Core was in sight. But now some kind of massive negative energy anomaly has surfaced above the Core, blocking access to it. ... We need you to explore the surrounding levels and collect any intel you can. You can start with an Owlite castle of some sort that recently surfaced near this anomaly` (<a href="https://wiki.spiralknights.com/Ending_in_Fire" target="_blank">Ending in Fire - Kora</a>), it is plausible for the wildwood at some point being affected by the <a href="https://wiki.spiralknights.com/The_Vile_Engine/Processing_Plant" target="_blank">slime generators</a> at depth 22.

As it was discussed earlier, we had proposed an existence of a [Vile Deity](#fiendish-cults), who is the reason behind supernatural occurrences related to poison, rot, and undeath across graveyards.

It is then a question weather it in fact exists and what is its influence onto material realm. And one argument that seems feasible is the existence of <a href="https://wiki.spiralknights.com/Plague_Essence" target="_blank">Plague Essence</a>: `A powerful essence left behind when a creature perishes from a particularly putrid disease.` as it is a material from the same tier and design as <a href="https://wiki.spiralknights.com/Everfrost" target="_blank">Everfrost</a> and <a href="https://wiki.spiralknights.com/Flame_Soul" target="_blank">Flame Souls</a>. We won't suggest, that a type of supernatural plague was utilized to create toxigels. But, a Underworld-originating plague, we suggest, is present in the Shadow Lairs version of Gloaming Wildwoods.

The reason to this consolidated in the effects of the miasma:

- Enemies affected by the miasma inflict poison.
- Snarbolax, in his shadowy form, gains poisonous properties as well as the design.
- The wildwoods are covered with a red mist.

The red mist is the main point of concern and a counter argument for Slime Generators being responsible for the creation of the miasma. So far, a few potential leads can be connected to this phenomenon:

- Red mist is similar to the glow of the vengeful shadow cloak of Maskeraith. Although the design differs, as the cloak has yellow lightning bolts within it, the mist does not.
- The context of the word Miasma across mythology is usually considered as a divine punishment and illness. The illness is present in the woods, but the punishment aspect remains unknown.

  We can attempt to link it to the fall of tortomega, through association with rage.

- The stone lantern found across the woods are similar to the Yukimi-Gata lanterns and <a href="https://www.onmarkproductions.com/html/5-elements-pagoda-gravestone.html" target="_blank">5-layer stone stupas</a>.

The second comparison, we believe, hides the nature of this miasma, as one originatingt from curse flowing from [distabilized grim gates](#grim-gates-portal-collapse), [described earlier](#grim-gates). We have proposed, that the reason for this large-scale spread of curse-related affliction is due to [Undercorp turning against Titans](#the-fall-of-titans), erasing their civilization through mechanical change of tortodrones.

##### True Citadel of Almirian Empire

<!-- `A powerful curse has overtaken the Firestorm Citadel, transforming its hordes and lead by the mighty Darkfire Vanaduke!` -->

Shadow Firestorm Citadel is in much regard far more dangerous than the regular counterpart. The presence of Nature Sprites and Darkfire Vanaduke, the lack of the console create unique conditions in order for it to exist within the canon. This is similar to the unknown chronology of Ice Royal Jelly Palace within the timeline.

To analyze nature of this variant of the Citadel, we have to start by isolating history and design of the general Firestorm Citadel.

It is known that it was the Grand Citadel of Almire (`From atop the highest tower of the Grand Citadel of Almire, Vanaduke watched his kingdom crumble. ... Many days later the citizens of Almire watched as fire began to erupt from the mountains. Leading an army of terrible fiends, Vanaduke returned to his kingdom, destroying the occupied forces of the two opposing kingdoms in a single day. In time the two kingdoms fell, Vanaduke's legion burning everything in their path. When he returned to Almire, it burned as well, for everywhere he went, and everything he touched was doomed to ash. With nothing left to destroy, his legions left him and returned to the mountains, leaving the king to sit in his throne of ash and cinder, all the people of Almire dead around him` - <a href="https://wiki.spiralknights.com/Firestorm_Citadel#Almire.27s_Fall" target="_blank">Almire's Fall</a>), `You stand before the gates of the Firestorm Citadel, the former heart of the great Kingdom of Almire, now a dominion twisted by fire and malice` ([King of Ashes - Blackstone Bridge - Lost Soul](<https://wiki.spiralknights.com/Lost_Soul_(Blackstone_Bridge)>)). Kingdom of Almire was located near the mountains, ones which held an altar to a fiery deity, which we concluded to be Vog, an Underworld deity. Almire's nature-themed designs, as well as a strong connection to Spirit Mother, which wos the reason for her intervention, resulting in capture of several Nature Sprites in the citadel itself by the time Lord Vanaduke had returned transformed.

At some point, it was captured by the Core, yet with its legions and cities seemingly intact.

Starting from thar point, Firestorm Citadel had resurfaced by the time Spiral Order got closer to the Core:

- `We thought things were getting pretty predictable, even at the depths you've been exploring. The Core was in sight. But now some kind of massive negative energy anomaly has surfaced above the Core, blocking access to it. Recon Knights have said that all they see near it is fire, endless fire. We don't know what it is just yet, but squads near that depth have already gone missing. This is bad news` (<a href="https://wiki.spiralknights.com/Ending_in_Fire" target="_blank">Ending in Fire - Kora</a>).
- `That mass of negative energy we've been investigating is a portion of an ancient kingdom called Almire, the very same realm described in that Owlite tome you discovered!` (<a href="https://wiki.spiralknights.com/Eye_of_the_Needle" target="_blank">Kora</a>).

Large number of followed up missions were concerned with getting in proximity of the Citadel:

- `We need you to explore the surrounding levels and collect any intel you can. You can start with an Owlite castle of some sort that recently surfaced near this anomaly` (<a href="https://wiki.spiralknights.com/Ending_in_Fire" target="_blank">Ending in Fire - Kora</a>).
- `An unlikely source of intel has surfaced from the residents of Moorcroft Manor. A few of the spookats that call it home contacted one of our visiting Recon Knights and provided details of the negative energy mass that has appeared above the Core. Calling it 'a place of burning hatred' and 'a prison for dark souls' they say that you can read all about it in 'one of those weird Owlite books' in an Owlite keep they pinpointed. If what they claim is true Spiral HQ could gain valuable intel from investigating the Owlite keep. Just remember that these Owlite structures have all proven to be swarming with the lost souls of countless undead monsters` (<a href="https://wiki.spiralknights.com/An_Occurrence_at_Owlite_Keep" target="_blank">An Occurrence at Owlite Keep</a>).

  It directly connects Scarlet Fortress, <a href="https://wiki.spiralknights.com/An_Occurrence_at_Owlite_Keep" target="_blank">The Hall of Remembrance</a>, to the <a href="https://wiki.spiralknights.com/File:Library.png" target="_blank">The Forgotten Library</a> of Owlite Academy, as it is located in the Candlestick Keep.

- `The Spookats of Moorcroft Manor have another valuable piece of intel for us that is worth investigating. They say that a lost soul of the former Kingdom of Almire resides in a soldier's graveyard near the Firestorm Citadel. This soul is willing to provide us with the information on the nature of the citadel as well as how we can get through it and reach the Core` (<a href="https://wiki.spiralknights.com/Alone_in_the_Dark" target="_blank">Alone in the Dark</a>).

  It contain both remains of Owlite Academy, the Candlestick Keep, and cooling chambers of Clockwork tunnels.

- <a href="https://wiki.spiralknights.com/Gauntlet" target="_blank">Gauntlet</a> itself is accessed through the Owlite Academy, transitioning, again, into the Scarlet Fortress. This time, notably, it contains most of the hazards, attributed also to gremlins - the freeze traps of cooling chambers. This was covered in the [gremlin containments section](). And here, we see more relation to the heavenly kingdom, as if it was surrounding the citadel.

Here we have to return to the topic of the [Forgotten Time](), as there we have discussed the possibility of Almire existing on the same planet as heavenly kingdom. Here, this positioning does raise suspicion, as geographically, through mythological inspirations, heavenly kingdom had to be located above the land of Ironmight Kingdom, tortomega ruins including Wildwoods and Aurora Isles, and Almire. At that point, as the planet had to be harvested, Aurora Isles would have to eventually end up being captured, but this would not explain the fact they, too, float. Unless the same technology used to hold up all of matter in skydomes, and elements of the Artifact and Console is applied.

We have mentioned that Carnavons and Slag Zombies have similar design and are only ones with explicit armor. One thing in particular is the following - if Carnavons are canon, their curse affliction is canon, would this make Shadow Firestorm Citadel canon? And if so, how would it fit with the existing one, apart from, for example, Shadow Lairs being a dream, unreal? Physically all of those location reach the shadow lairs proper - the unknown passage, - as only boss depths contain the first signs of the Swarm.

Another note on the canon of shadow lairs is the response to threat of the Swarm. There is no reaction on the result of an expedition into those. Event of <a href="https://wiki.spiralknights.com/It_Came_From_Below/Into_the_Maw" target="_blank">It Came From Below</a> demonstrate the threat of the Swarm without a follow-up. But, it demonstrates a possibility of shadow lairs rising into lower depth, as shown by the last depth of <a href="https://wiki.spiralknights.com/Unknown_Passage" target="_blank">A Descent into Darkness</a>, which is the <a href="https://wiki.spiralknights.com/Unknown_Passage" target="_blank">Unknown Passage</a>. As in the boss depths of shadow lairs, a depth preceding unknown passage is, in the very end, influenced by the Swarm.

Here we propose a solution, one which, we believe, organically solves several loose ends.

Owlites, as the heavenly kingdom above the mountains, had witnessed the events of 3 kingdoms, Ironmight and Almire. Then Lord Vanaduke has returned from the mountains with the Legion of Ur - of Isorian Wardens transformed to trojans. Then, as the Legion has returned into the mountains - the Underworld, and the new undead kingdom of Almire became the Almirian Empire. Vanaduke began the invasion into the heavenly kingdom with his undead army of legions of Almire. Due to this, greater developments in the understanding of curse had emerged, - it is during that, more early time closer to Almire's Fall and Almirian Empire, rather than one suggested in the beginning of [Kat Tribe chapter](). The understanding of curse allowed for existence of all described there items, including the Divine Avenger with the property of curse being inverted. And it was the weapon to defend against undead legions of Almire.

Through this logic, we finally reach the dread seal ond ones who bear it. Dread Seal is acquired from the <a href="https://wiki.spiralknights.com/Katastrophe_Prize_Box" target="_blank">Katastrophe Prize Box</a>, meaning, that it is associated with Owlites to a degree. In the accompanied <a href="https://wiki.spiralknights.com/News/2014" target="_blank">news art</a>, dread seal is placed on the Black Kat Mask, but more importantly, it is in a set with Chaos Cloak. Weather or not this design choice is canon, the fact that evil eye makes itself present on Owlite's Chaos Cloak may serve as a link to other Owlite researches regarding nature of curse, as discussed in the beginning of [Kat Tribe chapter]().

As the Chaos Cloak is forbidden, the dread seal places with it seem to suggest it being a mark of danger, or a restriction, as discussed in hte [analysis of curse](). Seal's design is similar to the Fu talisman in Taoist, as it is placed by priest on ghost's forehead in order to hinder it. With the prior knowledge of Black Kats and Almire, we suggest the seal is created by Owlites. This would coincide with their last actions of Warding Candles being placed, as another measure to defend against Underworld.

In relation to Almire, the seal is placed of Carnavons. The only time this would chronologically fit is if Owlites did fought with Almirian Empire, the one after Lord Vanaduke's return.

Dark Embers, while are acquired for Almirian Seal tokens, are said to be `salvaged from Lord Vanaduke's throne room. It slowly smolders with a sinister intensity, creating an almost hypnotic trance when gazed upon for any length of time` (<a href="https://wiki.spiralknights.com/Dark_Ember" target="_blank">Dark Ember</a>), which would only be thematically fitting - through color purple - if the entire Citadel was of that theme.

It was previously discussed that Vog's fiery curse, the reason for Vog Cubs existence, is the other curse related to more fire of natural color. Through this logic we followed to the idea of darkfire being a distinct phenomenon in the [nature of darkfire section](#nature-of-darkfire). There we selected 2 interpretation of darkfire - regular by now, - variation of the curse, and a distinct creation emerging from Vog's curse being overtaken by the Underworld's curse. Darkfire would not have a reason to exist in the throne room of regular fire.

It was stated that army within the citadel was transformed - that would eventually mean that all Slag Walkers had turned into Carnavons. Yet both are present across Clockworks outside of Shadow Lairs. Carnavons are summoned by Black Kats, which are themselves summoned by the Dark ritual which can pull banished entities from the Underworld, such as trojans. The Seal is placed by Owlites of valkyries on the cursed entities.

Then there are differences between Firestorm, Shadow Firestorm Citadel, and "Greenstone" Citadel of Shadowplay.

Designs of Greenstone Citadel and Firestorm Citadel are essentially the same. This follows with the idea of Shadow Lairs not being canon. The Overgrown Court has a part of Ashen Armory fallen to its level, which coincides with the general structure of Greenstone Citadel's less stable state, as it crumbles.

There are notable elements within the Shadow Firestorm Citadel.

- Much larger in quantity presence of metal chains. Chains themselves are much larger, going above and out of the view.
- More ramping arches present across the buildings surrounding the main area of depths, a less notable architectural change.
- Presence of wooden watchtower as well as usage of their components as, seemingly, reinforcements for the brickwork structure of the buildings.
- Almirian tapestry in several instances across the Shadow Firestorm Citadel is much larger in scale, as chains.
- All fire bowls have their yellow fire replaced with purple, which we proposed to be dark embers, as the same design is present in relation to undead locations, which also was a contributor to nature of darkfire as a regular phenomenon out of Underworld.
- Grim totems are more deeply integrated into the designs of Shadow Firestorm Citadels.

  In both regular and shadow citadel, presence of totems is questionable, apart from game design perspective as undead levels. Unless, those were introduced by devilites.

- Lord Vanaduke's design also differs.
  - The most notable element is presence of an intact purple cloak of Darkfire Vanaduke. Almire's crest shown on its back is most intact, compared to the torn, as <a href="https://wiki.spiralknights.com/Almire_Furniture#Doodads" target="_blank">Almirian tapestries</a>, cape of Firestorm Lord Vanaduke.
  - The clothes below Vanaduke's armor, as well as the cloak, have the same triangular pattern in the design of not sawn rags, but far more finely preserved. The cape also ends with the triangular shapes, similar to the valkyrian raiments.
  - The armor of Darkfire Vanaduke has the similar thematic change. It has no visible bolts and more monolithic, especially the face plate and chest, while the characteristic chains had remained. Moreover the part of armor around the face has more symbolic elements, a circle of outwards extending spikes. Due to this, we suggest it being symbolic to a medieval torture device, iron maiden specifically.

So, someone had to apply a curse onto the Citadel, which influenced the resulted state the Citadel is found in the Shadow Lairs.

Previously we have proposed, that due to wording on the Shadow Firestorm Citadel, Carnavons could've been cursed Slag Walker explained by the continuity itself. Yet, then a question remains - why only Carnavons have a shield, apart from being harder to hit from game-design perspective? Then the presence of Almire-aligned undead, including the royal guard - they, too, had to be justified to be present only in the Shadow Firestorm Citadel.

All of those elements make Shadow Firestorm Citadel far more authentic, compared to the Firestorm Citadel outside of Shadow Lairs. Presence of Dark Embers following curse theme should be a reason for this variant being the true one, an yet, Greenstone Citadel has all of the initial designs of the Firestorm Citadel.

##### Causality

Generally, as state in the beginning of [this section](#shadow-lairs), all Shadow Lairs follow a different continuity and chronology, almost a different timeline. Across all of the story at most surface level, and the over-analysis such as this, no manipulation to time were found. So, a different case presents itself - of a different canon, a an alternative interpretation to already visited events. Such example was found with Lord Vanaduke's mask and finery furniture, based on a fact both of them could not exist simultaneously, if both of them are not canonically transmuted but found.

The entire depth of Shadow Lairs also contains the unknown Passage, which was established as more canon than its iteration in It Came From Below, as the latter instance had no justified reason to contain Whitespace blocks while not leading into the Whitespace. Apart from this design, the events of this mission were not acknowledge in any form until a direct encounter with the Swarm during Dreams and Nightmares.

Here we can compare depths of Shroud of Apocrea to the Shadow Lairs - a notable distinction is to be made here - Apocrean depths have a <a href="https://wiki.spiralknights.com/Shroud_of_the_Apocrea/The_Grasping_Plateau" target="_blank">background</a>, which follows gate icon design pattern. Due to this, as well due to roster of Void enemies within the Unknown Passage, we can assume, that Swarm does modify what is intended to be seen on the gates, removing any distinction between nature of artificial, mechanical, and organic entities. With this assumption, the presence of Unknown Passage in the events of It Came From Below seems as if the Swarm itself was ascending from the Shadow Lairs. The influence it exceeds on surrounding depths is consistent across all encounters.

Based on the fact that slime generators were the reason behind knights unable to reach farther than depth 23, means that the terminal remained for a time the deepest point of exploration. So, this would mean that Shadow Lairs would not be accessible from any other location. Moreover, most of the locations preserve their structure, which, apart from game design efficiency reasons, would mean that those had fallen into the Shadow Lairs. This would fit chronologically, nearing the events of It Came From Below, as there Clockworks' behavior resulted in Swarm's presence outside of the Lairs, yet leading into the Unknown Passage, there named as Descend Into Darkness, rather than a name of physical location. Due to this we can attempt to fit events of Shadow Lairs right before the events of Shadowplay or after Dreams and Nightmares.

- `The Gloaming Wildwoods has been infected with a poisonous miasma and the Snarbolax is said to have gone rabid!`

  As discussed earlier, Snarbolax had to be defeated, unless it is not one of its kind. This can be potentially resolved through the presence of <a href="https://wiki.spiralknights.com/Snarblepup" target="_blank">Snarblepup</a>. Based on earlier instances of battle sprites reaving on Cradle's past, this could be an explanation for Rabid Snarbolax's existence.

- `The Royal Jelly Palace has frozen over and its king usurped by the true heir to the slimy throne, the frigid Ice Queen!`

  Could potentially mean that Ice Queen did arrive after the initial defeat of the Jelly King during <a href="https://wiki.spiralknights.com/The_Sovereign_Slime" target="_blank">Sovereign Slime</a>.

  And, if the Queen supposedly herself usurped the throne, this would not fit into the current timeline.

- `The Ironclaw Munitions Factory has begun creating in fiery weapons and improved upon its ultimate weapon in the form of the Red Roarmulus Twins!`

  The factory did contain multiple instances of Project R models, with 2 pods absent in the hangar. The first time Roarmulus Twins are mention is as follows: `Project R appears to be in fact two massive weapons known as the 'Roarmulus Twins.' Designed by one of the Crimson Order itself, the Roarmulus Twins are some kind of construct cannon that the gremlins intend on moving up the Clockworks into the Haven Arcade!` (<a href="https://wiki.spiralknights.com/Target_Acquired" target="_blank">Target Acquired - Kora</a>). Due to this, we can gather that at least within the logic of moving those into Haven, multiple of their instances would be present.

  Possibility of a scenario wherein gremlins would have to improve upon the existing model, we suggest, exists only under the condition of the previous iteration - the regular Roarmulus Twins, - were defeated. So, this would fit to the existing timeline of events, compared to the previous 2 instances.

- `A powerful curse has overtaken the Firestorm Citadel, transforming its hordes and lead by the mighty Darkfire Vanaduke!`

  With all of context in mind, for the cohesiveness of the narrative, we propose a potential 2 scenarios of fitting Shadow Firestorm Citadel and Darkfire Vanaduke into the timeline:

  - Earlier we have mentioned, that a curse had to be applied externally, which resulted in transformation of the Citadel. Yet, it is stated, that Lord Vanaduke was not defeated, but transformed, suggesting that this Lair had to be traversed prior to the Events of <a href="https://wiki.spiralknights.com/The_King_of_Ashes" target="_blank">The King of Ashes</a>.

    This scenario is possible if the canon version of the citadel which was traversed is the Shadow one. And, as this was debunked, we can suggest that the unseen during the events of Shadowplay floors were afflicted by curse, in order for Darkfire Vanaduke being the one to be defeated.

  - Shadow Firestorm citadel is the one Knights had to traverse after the events of Dreams and Nightmares.

    How it would be possible, as it is during Shadowplay we discover the overgrown state of the Citadel? Here we would consider the connection to the activated console with the Artifact: `Though the nature sprites have been steadily making progress in fighting the flames, something or someone has recently caused a violent resurgence in its destructive power` (<a href="https://wiki.spiralknights.com/Shadowplay" target="_blank">Shadowplay</a>), as the <a href="https://wiki.spiralknights.com/Shadowplay/Throne_Room" target="_blank">Throne Room</a> remains in the same fiery environment, even with the remains of the supposed ceiling after Lord Vanaduke's initial fight during <a href="https://wiki.spiralknights.com/The_King_of_Ashes" target="_blank">The King of Ashes</a>. As the Artifact had remained in the console, we can only suggest, that this was the reason for the reanimation of the Citadel.

    This would simultaneously explain presence of dark embers as a material in small quantity, and allow for the thematically fitting counterpart to be present. To explore this resolution, we have to look at the nature of the curse and parallels across the stories involving it.

    As tortodrones, reactivated by dark matter, as Margrel, summoned from the Underworld, Darkfire Vanaduke has more distinct presence of purple cracks across his armor. Paired with the idea of curse being applied to the citadel, we can gather, that this has to involve devilites, and Nefarious Imp at that. We can suggest so also due to reasoning of gremlins attempting to contain citadel's fires in the [suggested in gremlin containments section]().

    Due to this, Nature Sprites would be still present, but, absence of the console would not. Same applied for the Ice Queen, as her version of the Royal Jelly Palace also lacks the console. The only way to resolve this is to suggest that it was removed by actions of currently unknown actor, without leaning to a game direction and design reasons.

#### Alchemical Symbolism of Shadow Lairs: Great Work and Rebis

We propose, that Shadow Lairs as a separate expedition, contain a thematic element to them, found through their symbolic themes relating to alchemy, but also the Void: `I DREAM... WITHIN MY DREAM I SAW IT OPEN THE VOID, FELT ITS ENDLESS HUNGER. YOU ARE SAFE HERE, KNIGHT. WITHIN THIS DREAM, ITS MANY EYES CANNOT SEE YOU NOR CAN ITS MANY ARMS REACH YOU.` ([Echo Stone: Gloaming Wildwoods](https://wiki.spiralknights.com/Echo_Stone:_Gloaming_Wildwoods)). We will suggest` an idea of this Void is one being related to the alchemical Void, until then we will mainly focus on the symbolism of Shadow Lairs' expeditions, as in regards to all things Swarm-related, any assumption can and likely will swing final conclusion into an area of speculation. So, due to this, we are not about to make distinct claims, but rather point out the symbolic elements.

The notion of a descend into the Shadow Lairs, through the Unknown Passage, into the Sanctuary, and acquisition of a rare material, unique to the lair is, we believe, is an alchemical metaphor for the process of creation of the Great Work, and of a particular kind. By that we mean, as the phenomenon of alchemy as of pseudo-chemistry is rooted from a projection of inner consciousness onto a physical world, its elements also become symbolic. The theme is concealed in the alchemical process itself, and its final goal, here described from the english translation of Carl Jung's "Psychology and Alchemy":

<BookCitation source="Psychology and Alchemy - Carl Jung">

`In the hero myth this state is known as being swallowed up in the belly of the whale or dragon. The heat there is usually so intense that the hero loses his hair, i.e., he is reborn bald as a babe. This heat is the ignis gehennalis, the hell into which Christ descended in order to conquer death as part of his opus. The philosopher makes the journey to hell as a “redeemer.” The “hidden fire” forms the inner antithesis to the cold wetness of the sea.`

`The “treasure hard to attain,” whose presence was suspected in the dark prima materia, is symbolized by the alchemists in various ways. Christopher of Paris, for instance, says that the chaos (as prima materia) is the work of all-wise nature. Our understanding ... , aided by the “celestial and glowing spirit,” must transform this natural work of art—chaos—into the celestial nature of the quintessence, and into the life- giving (vegetabilis) essence of heaven. The precious substance is potentially contained in this chaos as a massa confusa of all the elements rolled into one, and man must diligently apply his mind to it so that “our heaven” may come into reality (ad actum). Johannes Grasseus quotes the view that the prima materia is the lead (plumbum) of the philosophers, also called the “lead of the air” (an allusion to the inner opposite). This lead contains the radiant white dove, called the “salt of the metals.” The dove is the “chaste, wise, and rich Queen of Sheba, veiled in white, who was willing to give herself to none but King Solomon.”`

`A similar idea is to be found in Michael Maier: The sun, by its many millions of revolutions, spins the gold into the earth. Little by little the sun has imprinted its image on the earth, and that image is the gold. The sun is the image of God, the heart is the sun’s image in man, just as gold is the sun’s image in the earth (also called Deus terrenus), and God is known in the gold. This golden image of God is the anima aurea, which, when breathed into common quicksilver, changes it into gold.`

`Ripley is of the opinion that the fire must be extracted from the chaos and made visible. This fire is the Holy Ghost, who unites father and son. He is often represented as a winged old man, i.e., Mercurius in the form of the god of revelation, who is identical with Hermes Trismegistus and, together with the King and the King’s Son, forms the alchemical trinity. God wrought this fire in the bowels of the earth, just as he wrought the purging flames of hell, and in this fire God himself glows with divine love.`

`The examples given in the last chapter show that there is a spirit hidden in the prima materia, just as there was in the Nile stone of Ostanes. This spirit was eventually interpreted as the Holy Ghost in accordance with the ancient tradition of the Nous swallowed up by the darkness while in the embrace of Physis—with this difference, however, that it is not the supreme feminine principle, earth, who is the devourer, but Nous in the form of Mercurius or the tail-eating Uroboros. In other words, the devourer is a sort of material earth-spirit, an hermaphrodite possessing a masculine-spiritual and feminine-corporeal aspect. The original Gnostic myth has undergone a strange transformation: Nous and Physis are indistinguishably one in the prima materia and have become a natura abscondita.`

`The psychological equivalent of this theme is the projection of a highly fascinating unconscious content which, like all such contents, exhibits a numinous—“divine” or “sacred”—quality. Alchemy set itself the task of acquiring this “treasure hard to attain” and of producing it in visible form, as the physical gold or the panacea or the transforming tincture—in so far as the art still busied itself in the laboratory. But since the practical, chemical work was never quite free from the unconscious contents of the operator which found expression in it, it was at the same time a psychic activity which can best be compared with what we call active imagination. This method enables us to get a grasp of contents that also find expression in dream life. The process is in both cases an irrigation of the conscious mind by the unconscious, and it is related so closely to the world of alchemical ideas that we are probably justified in assuming that alchemy deals with the same, or very similar, processes as those involved in active imagination and in dreams, i.e., ultimately with the process of individuation.`

`Earlier on, we left Arisleus and his companions, together with Beya and the dead Thabritius, in the triple glass house where they had been imprisoned by the Rex marinus. They suffer from the intense heat, like the three whom Nebuchadnezzar cast into the fiery furnace. King Nebuchadnezzar had a vision of a fourth, “like the Son of God,” as we are told in Daniel 3 : 25. This vision is not without bearing on alchemy, since there are numerous passages in the literature stating that the stone is trinus et unus. It consists of the four elements, with fire representing the spirit concealed in matter. This is the fourth, absent and yet present, who always appears in the fiery agony of the furnace and symbolizes the divine presence—succour and the completion of the work.`

</BookCitation>

And, through the four stages of alchemical process:

<BookCitation source="Psychology and Alchemy - Carl Jung">

`Four stages are distinguished, characterized by the original colours mentioned in Heraclitus: melanosis (blackening), leukosis (whitening), xanthosis (yellowing), and iosis (reddening). This division of the process into four was called the, the quartering of the philosophy. Later, about the fifteenth or sixteenth century, the colours were reduced to three, and the xanthosis, otherwise called the citrinitas, gradually fell into disuse or was but seldom mentioned. Instead, the viriditas sometimes appears after the melanosis or nigredo in exceptional cases, though it was never generally recognized. Whereas the original tetrameria corresponded exactly to the quaternity of elements, it was now frequently stressed that although there were four elements (earth, water, fire, and air) and four qualities (hot, cold, dry, and moist), there were only three colours: black, white, and red. Since the process never led to the desired goal and since the individual parts of it were never carried out in any standardized manner, the change in the classification of its stages cannot be due to extraneous reasons but has more to do with the symbolical significance of the quaternity and the trinity; in other words, it is due to inner psychological reasons.`

`The nigredo or blackness is the initial state, either present from the beginning as a quality of the prima materia, the chaos or massa confusa, or else produced by the separation (solutio, separatio, divisio, putrefactio) of the elements. If the separated condition is assumed at the start, as sometimes happens, then a union of opposites is performed under the likeness of a union of male and female (called the coniugium, matrimonium, coniunctio, coitus), followed by the death of the product of the union (mortificatio, calcinatio, putrefactio) and a corresponding nigredo. From this the washing (ablutio, baptisma) either leads direct to the whitening (albedo), or else the soul (anima) released at the “death” is reunited with the dead body and brings about its resurrection, or again the “many colours” (omnes colores), or “peacock’s tail” (cauda pavonis), lead to the one white colour that contains all colours. At this point the first main goal of the process is reached, namely the albedo, tinctura alba, terra alba foliata, lapis albus, etc., highly prized by many alchemists as if it were the ultimate goal. It is the silver or moon condition, which still has to be raised to the sun condition. The albedo is, so to speak, the daybreak, but not till the rubedo is it sunrise. The transition to the rubedo is formed by the citrinitas, though this, as we have said, was omitted later. The rubedo then follows direct from the albedo as the result of raising the heat of the fire to its highest intensity. The red and the white are King and Queen, who may also celebrate their “chymical wedding” at this stage.`

`The prima materia was thought of as an ever-changing substance, or else as the essence or soul of that substance. It was designated with the name “Mercurius,” and was conceived as a paradoxical double being called monstrum, hermaphroditus, or rebis. The lapis-Christ parallel establishes an analogy between the transforming substance and Christ, in the Middle Ages doubtless under the influence of the doctrine of transubstantiation, though in earlier times the Gnostic tradition of older pagan ideas was the dominant factor. Mercurius is likened to the serpent hung on the cross (John 3 : 14), to mention only one of the numerous parallels.`

`The “Cantilena” ends with the apotheosis of the virgin-mother. This the above-mentioned Pandora depicts as a glorification of Mary, the assumptio Beatae Mariae Virginis. After her death, by a divine miracle her body was again united with her soul and both together were taken up to heaven. This has long been the view of the Church, although it has only recently been promulgated as a dogma. [In fig. 232] she is marked with the words “terra” and “corpus Lyb” (body) and “die wonn der jung-frowenn wardt” (who became the joy of virgins); the dove descends upon her, and God the Father touches her with his right hand in benison. She is crowned. The figure of God holding the orb is inscribed “Anima Seel” and “Jesse pater, filius et mater.” “Mater” refers to the Queen of Heaven enthroned beside him, the King; for in her the earth substance, becoming transfigured in her resurrected body, is absorbed into the Godhead. On the left is a bearded figure equal in rank to God the Father, inscribed “Sapientia Wyssheit.” In the shield below there is a picture of the rebis being freed from the prima materia.`

`In the stone, as we know, the chaotic antagonism of the elements is replaced by the most intense mutual alliance, which is what makes the stone incorruptible, this being the reason why, in our author’s opinion, it has the same effect as the blood of the Saviour: “sanitas atque vita diuturna in foelicitate, propter quam praecipue lapis noster est petendus” (health and long life in felicity, on account of which our stone is chiefly to be sought).`

`Therefore Mercurius philosophorum is to be considered a spiritual body, as the philosophers call him. From God the Father was born his own Son Jesus Christ, who is God and man, and is without sin, and who also had no need to die. But he died of his own free will, and rose again for the sake of his brothers and sisters, that they might live with him without sin for ever. So, too, is the gold without flaw, and is fixed, potent to withstand all examinations, and glorious; yet, for the sake of its imperfect and sick brothers and sisters, it dies and rises again, glorious and redeemed, and tinctures them to eternal life, making them perfect like to pure gold.`

`It is clear enough from this material what the ultimate aim of alchemy really was: it was trying to produce a corpus subtile, a transfigured and resurrected body, i.e., a body that was at the same time spirit. In this it finds common ground with Chinese alchemy, as we have learned from The Secret of the Golden Flower. There the main concern is the “diamond body,” in other words, the attainment of immortality through the transformation of the body. The diamond is an excellent symbol because it is hard, fiery, and translucent. Orthelius tells us that the philosophers have never found a better medicament than that which they called the noble and blessed stone of the philosophers, on account of its hardness, transparency, and rubeous hue.`

</BookCitation>

Here we are to apply this concept on Shadow Lairs, we propose a following correspondence.

Isorians crash land on Cradle due to their search of an energy source, which is the Core. Paralleling to it an idea introduced by knights starting to feel as if they were intended to crash land.

Then there are the materials. We suggest an existence of a parallel in the materials acquired in the Sanctuary depending on the Shadow Lair, and stages of the Work. The three prior materials represent the alchemical stages - a metaphorical process of transformation of Prima Materia. This symbolism is depicted in the <a href="https://wiki.spiralknights.com/Nightmare_Mane" target="_blank">Nightmare Mane</a> - being the blackening, <a href="https://wiki.spiralknights.com/Celestial_Ore" target="_blank">Celestial Ore</a> - the whitening, and then to <a href="https://wiki.spiralknights.com/Gremlonium" target="_blank">Gremlonium</a> - the reddening. <a href="https://wiki.spiralknights.com/Gremlonium" target="_blank">Gremlonium</a> - `A highly advanced compound created by gremlin engineers to power their most devious machines`, seems to be a red powder, which is the same as powder of projection in 12-step process of Great Work.

Then, there is <a href="https://wiki.spiralknights.com/Maiden%27s_Tear" target="_blank">Maiden's Tear</a>, it is a sacred jewel, and, we believe, in conjunction with the theme of fire due to traversal of the Shadow Firestorm Citadel, serves as the metaphorical crucible for the creation of the Great Work of Prime Matter, referring to Isorians, literally being forged - prepared, - to take on the Swarm. Firestorm Citadel serves as the fire of `highest intensity`, from which Maiden's Tear, a sacred jewel, finally emerges. It is the representation of the reunion of 2 Isorian pasts - one of Isora, and one of Almire, - symbolized by the alchemical path of the Almirian Crusader set, as reunion of the known, or conscious, - Isora from where their thought-to-be-destined journey begins; and unknown, of the unconscious, of Almire.

In additional, while potentially misleading, component to this proposal is the arrangement of Red King and White Queen who through the metaphor of union create the divine Rebis. Within the cosmology of Spiral Knights there are such figures: the supposed genius king Tinkinzar, associated with the Crimson Order, and Spirit Mother, which we propose to be a divine and benevolent entity, closely related to Almire, who can be consider as White - the White Queen, is the unity of both requiring to achieve an enlightened or complete state of being. But, this endeavour would fail manifested as the Swarm, - currently a speculation, but one we will provide substance throughout the following analysis of the Swarm.

#### The Swarm

Architect-Core-Cradle-Sleeper relation must be looked at through the lens of narrative analysis and themes, in conjunction with the events - arcs and themes, - preceding the Clockworks.

##### Location of a Breach into the Core

We will begin from the though, suggesting that the Swarm was within the Core this entire time, taken at face value:

- `The recon module you collected is very strange. I have no reason to believe what Parma was saying isn't true, but how it happened I just can't say. Everything about the Core suggests there are no 'doors' into it. its not a structure built to enter from the outside. Rather, it seems just the opposite` (<a href="https://wiki.spiralknights.com/Vaelyn" target="_blank">The Search Continues - Vaelyn</a>).
- `If the Core isn't kept sealed The Swarm will escape and it will continue to consume everything and everyone.` (<a href="https://wiki.spiralknights.com/Vaelyn" target="_blank">Dreams and Nightmares - Parma's Scout</a>)
- `Who could have guessed that this 'Swarm' was just waiting for someone to stumble across the Core and free it?` (<a href="https://wiki.spiralknights.com/Kora" target="_blank">Delved Too Deep - Kora</a>).
- `Such power! I never imagined...! ...and it will be unleashed. You! I will make you its first victims` <a href="https://wiki.spiralknights.com/Dreams_and_Nightmares/The_Path_is_Revealed" target="_blank">Dreams and Nightmares - The Path is Revealed - Herex</a>.

But then a question arises - how the Swarm was able to feed on Core while sealed within, when it is directly encountered in the most active to date state within the Shadow Lairs? And, with an access elevator to Sanctuary from the <a href="https://wiki.spiralknights.com/Unknown_Passage" target="_blank">Unknown Passage</a>? Essentially, the question is - where is the Swarm coming from, from the inside of the Core or from the Shadow Lairs?

As Parma told, the Swarm breached the Core - `We've taken to calling it The Sleeper. We aren't sure what it is exactly, but it needs our help. This world was created to protect it but somehow The Swarm breached the Core and has been feeding on the energy and growing like a leech ever since` (<a href="https://wiki.spiralknights.com/Dreams_and_Nightmares/Refuge" target="_blank">Dreams and Nightmares - Refuge - Parma's Scout</a>), leading to a conclusion of reachability of the power source under normal conditions of Core being sealed. If power source is located outside of the Core, the Swarm had no reason to breach it?

Despite the location, where the Swarm had originated, outside or within the Core, the breach should serve as a connection between the Core and the rest of the world. Here we propose a potential solution, to one which we will return to analyze in detail and how it applies to both cases of Swarm's location - the entrance to the Sanctuary in the end of the unknown Passage is the breach, Parma had spoken of.

As Unknown Passage ends, already in the most severe destroyed state of Clockwork tunnel within the skydome, the elevator to the Sanctuary is completely cut off. If the Sanctuary is located within the Core, which will assume for now, but wll also discuss, this elevator should by that logic go through the breach.

By that logic the Sanctuary is to be located within the Core.

The space beyond mechanical skydome of Clockworks design is pure white, nowhere else we find design as such outside of the Core's <a href="https://wiki.spiralknights.com/Dreams_and_Nightmares/Refuge" target="_blank">Refuge</a>.

If the skydome was outside of the Core, Spiral HQ surely would notice such tremendous amount of energy cycling through the Clockworks. Yet, it could be shaded by the Swarm, as in case of other locations residing in the Shadow Lairs, but, considering the theme of Whitespace and Refuge, we are confident that the Sanctuary is within the Core, as it is stated to be safe (`YOU ARE SAFE HERE, KNIGHT. WITHIN THIS DREAM, ITS MANY EYES CANNOT SEE YOU NOR CAN ITS MANY ARMS REACH YOU.` - [Echo Stone: Gloaming Wildwoods](https://wiki.spiralknights.com/Echo_Stone:_Gloaming_Wildwoods)), is it has a limited capacity to repel the Swarm, as suggested by Parma: `The Swarm breached the Core and has been feeding on the energy and growing like a leech ever since. ... The Swarm keeps growing stronger while The Sleeper grows weaker` (<a href="https://wiki.spiralknights.com/Dreams_and_Nightmares/Refuge" target="_blank">Dreams and Nightmares - Refuge - Parma's Scout</a>).

Here we have to bring up previous idea of Shadow Firestorm Citadel, as its unknown Passage leads to the Sanctuary, - this does not seem to thematically fit with the events of Dreams and Nightmares, as by that time the name of Swarm would be revealed.

Then it is the proposal of Sanctuary located outside of the Core. Spiral HQ has the technology to detect surges of energy and accompanied consoles' activation. But, they hadn't noticed anything apart from energy surges by activation of Consoles during and relatively prior to the main rank missions.

There is a question then - how HQ had not discovered Darkfire Firestorm Citadel? It must be somewhere in the Shadow Lairs, but it seems that they would not if not for the proximity to the Core and Recon Knights: `But now some kind of massive negative energy anomaly has surfaced above the Core, blocking access to it` (<a href="https://wiki.spiralknights.com/Kora" target="_blank">Ending in Fire - Kora</a>).

Sanctuary skydome can potentially be hidden within Cradle's volume but, as mentioned, it would be thematically incorrect for 2 identical location being located outside and inside the Core under the current cosmology. Yet, we have to discuss weather Unknown passage is located in the Core, and by extensions, Shadow Lair, as lon as their is vagueness, those possibilities should not be removed completely.

Whitespace design is nowhere present except the Core, as we explore them in <a href="https://wiki.spiralknights.com/Dreams_and_nightmares" target="_blank">Dreams and Nightmares</a>. <a href="https://wiki.spiralknights.com/Dreams_and_Nightmares/Refuge" target="_blank">Refuge</a>, despite having a Core elevator icon, has the same design of skydome as the Sanctuary and Whitespace blocks. The question is then: why the Sanctuary has a different elevator icon? For this we have to hold on to the idea of a Dream as a tangible concept, which refers to a physical space.

At current point, Swarm's location can be interpreted in 2 ways:

1. The Swarm is located within the Core. Then it breaching the Core means getting outside of the Core.

   It is visibly present on the outside as in the events of Shadow Lairs and It Came From Below's Into The Maw. As the depth's name of Descend into Darkness is used twice - in the context of <a href="https://wiki.spiralknights.com/Dreams_and_Nightmares/Descent_into_Darkness" target="_blank">Dreams and Nightmares</a> and of <a href="https://wiki.spiralknights.com/It_Came_From_Below#Gate_Map" target="_blank">Unknown Passage</a> preceded by <a href="https://wiki.spiralknights.com/It_Came_From_Below/Into_the_Maw" target="_blank">Into the Maw</a>. We won't discard the potential for Shadow Lair being in the Core.

   This part of the Swarm could be the one escaping from the Core through the breach - this Swarm feeds of the energy from outside of the Core as if its internals do not provide it the means to persist. The distinction here is made between energy presence across power complexes and wires, and the Whitespace of the Core.

   Yet, it was stated that Swarm was mirroring itself within the Dream:

   `IT GREW STRONGER, ENDLESSLY MIRRORING ITSELF WITHIN THE SPACE OF MY DREAM. ENDLESSLY MIRRORING... EXPANDING... INFINITE.` ([Echo Stone: Firestorm Citadel](https://wiki.spiralknights.com/Echo_Stone:_Firestorm_Citadel))

   We will keep this concept of a Dream and act of mirroring in mind. One thing is certain here, the only deific entity, related to themes of Whitespace is the Sleeper due to lack of any other contestants, as well as this entity being the only one referring to the Swarm only through interaction with the Sleeper:

   - `WHAT IT WAS BEFORE IT IS NO MORE. NEITHER BEAST NOR GOD, IT IS A CREATION UNLIKE ALL. IT IS... THE SWARM.` ([Echo Stone: Firestorm Citadel](https://wiki.spiralknights.com/Echo_Stone:_Firestorm_Citadel)).
   - `he fell while protecting us from The Swarm. He stood his ground even when the rest of us were forced to flee. ... But then...then the light surrounded us and we were safe. We've taken to calling it The Sleeper. We aren't sure what it is exactly, but it needs our help. This world was created to protect it but somehow The Swarm breached the Core and has been feeding on the energy and growing like a leech ever since.` (<a href="https://wiki.spiralknights.com/Refuge" target="_blank">Dreams and Nightmare - Refuge - Parma's Scout</a>).

2. The Swarm is located in the Clockworks outside of the Core, within the stratum of Unknown Passage or the Shadow Lairs generally. Breaching the Core in that context means entering it from the outside, and feeding on energy within the Core, the Whitespace.

   As the event of <a href="https://wiki.spiralknights.com/Dreams_and_Nightmares" target="_blank">Dreams and Nightmares</a> suggest, Swarm's concentration within the Core is seen in lesser amount, yet <a href="https://wiki.spiralknights.com/Dreams_and_Nightmares/Descent_into_Darkness" target="_blank">growing by the depth</a>, at least by fact of currently absent <a href="https://wiki.spiralknights.com/The_Swarm#Swarm_Source" target="_blank">Swarm Sources</a>.

##### Sleeper's Location, Sanctuary, and Refuge

The Sanctuary <a href="https://wiki.spiralknights.com/Echo_Stone#Echo_Stone" target="_blank">Echo Stones</a> tell:

`I DREAM... WITHIN MY DREAM I SAW IT OPEN THE VOID, FELT ITS ENDLESS HUNGER. YOU ARE SAFE HERE, KNIGHT. WITHIN THIS DREAM, ITS MANY EYES CANNOT SEE YOU NOR CAN ITS MANY ARMS REACH YOU.` ([Echo Stone: Gloaming Wildwoods](https://wiki.spiralknights.com/Echo_Stone:_Gloaming_Wildwoods))

The punctuation is crucial here. A void opened not within the dream, but the Sleeper saw the void opening from his dreaming state.

Despite it, the Dream placement must be questioned - what and where is it? Is it the Core, metaphysical state, Cradle, or the Sanctuary skydome? The latter is of particular interest, as in the context of entering the Sanctuary for the first time, from the Shadow Gloaming Wildwoods, which was initially the first unlocked Lair (`Shadow Lairs are grouped into three ranks. All knights with Tier 3 clearance automatically gain Shadow Lair Clearance 1. Completing a Shadow Lair Rank 1 earns you clearance into the next rank and so on.` - [Release Notes: 2011.10.19](https://wiki.spiralknights.com/Release_Notes_2011-10-19)), it is the Sanctuary which is referred to as a `fleeting dream`.

There're mentions of a Dream in other instances:

- `I DREAM ... WITHIN MY DREAM I SAW IT OPEN THE VOID, FELT ITS ENDLESS HUNGER.` ([Echo Stone: Gloaming Wildwoods](https://wiki.spiralknights.com/Echo_Stone:_Gloaming_Wildwoods))
- `WITHIN THIS DREAM, ITS MANY EYES CANNOT SEE YOU NOR CAN ITS MANY ARMS REACH YOU.` ([Echo Stone: Gloaming Wildwoods](https://wiki.spiralknights.com/Echo_Stone:_Gloaming_Wildwoods))
- `BUT THIS DREAM IS FLEETING. USE WHAT IS HERE TO PREPARE FOR THE BATTLE TO COME.` ([Echo Stone: Gloaming Wildwoods](https://wiki.spiralknights.com/Echo_Stone:_Gloaming_Wildwoods))
- `I DREAM ... WITHIN MY DREAM I SEE YOUR LEGION FALLING TO THIS WORLD LIKE BURNING STARS.` ([Echo Stone: Royal Jelly Palace](https://wiki.spiralknights.com/Echo_Stone:_Royal_Jelly_Palace))
- `IT GREW STRONGER, ENDLESSLY MIRRORING ITSELF WITHIN THE SPACE OF MY DREAM.` ([Echo Stone: Firestorm Citadel](https://wiki.spiralknights.com/Echo_Stone:_Firestorm_Citadel))

The Sleeper's `my dream` and `this dream` are places, potentially separated spatially, and possibly, temporally, as the Sleeper talks about the Swarm in the past tense - `I SAW`, `FELT`, `IT GREW`, but also in the present - `USE WHAT IS HERE`, `I SEE YOUR LEGION`. The structure of the sentence suggests, that the Sleeper is not sleeping during the event of the game, as only 2 Echo stones specifically say the Sleeper is dreaming, [Echo Stone: Royal Jelly Palace](https://wiki.spiralknights.com/Echo_Stone:_Royal_Jelly_Palace) and [Echo Stone: Firestorm Citadel](https://wiki.spiralknights.com/Echo_Stone:_Firestorm_Citadel) seem more like statements, more direct and urgent. This pattern seems intentional, as if the Sleeper was weakened by the time it awakened by the Swarm as it "breached" the Core, which is confirmed by Parma: `The Swarm keeps growing stronger while The Sleeper grows weaker` (<a href="https://wiki.spiralknights.com/Dreams_and_Nightmares/Refuge" target="_blank">Parma's Scout</a>).

In that interpretation, the `fleeting dream` is Sleeper's `my dream`, from which it seemingly awakens, or at least capable to communicate. It seems correct to assume that the place where Sleeper is - a proposal of it being the Sanctuary, as the most fortified against influence of the Swarm, - leads to an idea that Sleeper is in the Sanctuary. Yet, which only narrows the identity of a Dream. For that we have to look at a different word - the world.

##### The World

The World is mentioned several times across Echo Stones:

- `WITHIN MY DREAM I SEE YOUR LEGION FALLING TO THIS WORLD LIKE BURNING STARS.` ([Echo Stone: Royal Jelly Palace](https://wiki.spiralknights.com/Echo_Stone:_Royal_Jelly_Palace)).
- `THIS WORLD WAS CREATED TO PROTECT ME` (Echo Stone: Ironclaw Munitions Factory).
- `VULNERABLE IN SLUMBER, WORLDS WERE DRAWN TO SHIELD ME FROM THE DARKNESS.` ([Echo Stone: Ironclaw Munitions Factory](https://wiki.spiralknights.com/Echo_Stone:_Ironclaw_Munitions_Factory))
- `THIS WORLD HAS BECOME MY PRISON.` ([Echo Stone: Ironclaw Munitions Factory](https://wiki.spiralknights.com/Echo_Stone:_Ironclaw_Munitions_Factory)).

Those quotes make seem like the word "world" refers both to Cradle and the "worlds" contained within the skydomes. But how they were drawn to shield the Sleeper, except through the rotation within the clockworks? Does this mean that Cradle itself as an entity separate from the Core?

This gives another clue to Sleeper's physical location, - within the Core - the Sanctuary specifically, or being the Core. The Core at the Core Terminal does not seem particularly large, seemingly capable of containing a single skydome. This raises the question of plausibility of Refuge and Sanctuary being different locations.

With the established physics of Whitespace, it is capable of manifesting matter - Whitespace blocks, out of "nothing", - could it be that the volume of the Core is far larger than it is perceived on the outside?

Notably, behavior of Whitespace is similar to the <a href="https://wiki.spiralknights.com/Ghost_Block#Ghost_Block" target="_blank">Ghost Blocks</a>. Ghost Blocks have a light-blue glow of the Core and Artifact, while having a depiction of curse to the one on gremlin Collector's back. We don't currently know of its meaning apart from possessing a capacity to make matter disappear.

If, hypothetically, the Whitespace of the Core is infinite, how Sleeper could grow weaker within the infinite volume? It might be that the Sanctuary is finite, defined by its skydome, and it is within an infinite space of literal white space of the Core. Within this logic, the Whitespace would be only entity accompanied Sleeper and contained within the Core, meaning that it is the source of energy. The idea of infinite space of Whitespace can be suggested by the Echo Stone:

`IT GREW STRONGER, ENDLESSLY MIRRORING ITSELF WITHIN THE SPACE OF MY DREAM. ENDLESSLY MIRRORING... EXPANDING... INFINITE.` ([Echo Stone: Firestorm Citadel](https://wiki.spiralknights.com/Echo_Stone:_Firestorm_Citadel))

If this statement is taken literally, does that mean, that Whitespace is a different realm, or at least at its border, as skydome and regular matter clearly exists intact?

While the Dream is either the Core or Whitespace or the Sanctuary, option of skydome being the Sleeper's dream presents an opportunity for a World to be referring either to Cradle or Core's artificial shell and above, including Cradle. We know that the worlds referred to, are ones in skydomes, and the world in general implies Cradle, so this might in fact solidify a suggestion that the Sleeper is within the Sanctuary, the only safe place, as stated by itself as well as by lack of the Swarm in <a href="https://wiki.spiralknights.com/Dreams_and_Nightmares/Refuge" target="_blank">Dreams and Nightmares</a> while being followed by it in <a href="https://wiki.spiralknights.com/Dreams_and_Nightmares/Descent_into_Darkness" target="_blank">Descent into Darkness</a>:

`YOU ARE SAFE HERE, KNIGHT. WITHIN THIS DREAM, ITS MANY EYES CANNOT SEE YOU NOR CAN ITS MANY ARMS REACH YOU.` ([Echo Stone: Gloaming Wildwoods](https://wiki.spiralknights.com/Echo_Stone:_Gloaming_Wildwoods))

The phrasing `NOR CAN ITS MANY ARMS REACH YOU` is similar to the following lines:

- `I lost sight of him as things went black. It felt like a thousand hands were pulling us away. As if something didn't want us to follow` <a href="https://wiki.spiralknights.com/Vaelyn" target="_blank">Dreams and Nightmares - A Step Beyond - Vaelyn</a>.
- `Luckily I was able to pull some strings and find you an exit` <a href="https://wiki.spiralknights.com/Dreams_and_Nightmares/Refuge" target="_blank">Dreams and Nightmares - Refuge - Parma's Scout</a> - the scenario of ending up within the skydome of the Core is familiar to the Shadow Lairs leading to Sanctuary.

  Since the latter mission was before the Core opening, it is quite possible, the the Sleeper or the same Alpha Squad member, through the breach, arranged for the Knight to enter the Sanctuary. Sleeper there mentions through the Echo Stone: `YOU ARE SAFE HERE, KNIGHT. WITHIN THIS DREAM, ITS MANY EYES CANNOT SEE YOU NOR CAN ITS MANY ARMS REACH YOU.` ([Echo Stone: Gloaming Wildwoods](https://wiki.spiralknights.com/Echo_Stone:_Gloaming_Wildwoods)).

This wording makes it seem like the "arms" are reaching from the outside, and, considering that in both current scenarios knight escapes into the whitespace, it seems that the arms are outside of the Core. The only reason why arms would be present if they were preventing anyone entering the Core. Swarm, with its current goals (`IT DEVOURED THE KNOWLEDGE OF TIME... MEMORIES OF THE DEAD... THE HEARTS OF KINGS AND THE SOULS OF THEIR PEOPLE... GOOD AND EVIL... IT CONSUMED.` - [Echo Stone: Firestorm Citadel](https://wiki.spiralknights.com/Echo_Stone:_Firestorm_Citadel)), had no reason to prevent anyone, if it does not present a danger to it. This is an argument for Swarms location being in the Core in its fullest extent, but not the Shadow Lairs themselves, if we consider Unknown Passage being above the Core during <a href="https://wiki.spiralknights.com/It_Came_From_Below/Into_the_Maw" target="_blank">It Came From Below</a>.

Parma mentions of exit: `I knew I'd never make it here in time when I noticed your signal. Luckily I was able to pull some strings and find you an exit` (<a href="https://wiki.spiralknights.com/Dreams_and_Nightmares/Refuge" target="_blank">Dreams and Nightmares - Refuge - Parma's Scout</a>). It suggests that the knight and Vaelyn were in danger, as evident by higher Swarm presence, as well as by the naming of the prior depth - <a href="https://wiki.spiralknights.com/Dreams_and_Nightmares/Descent_into_Darkness" target="_blank">Descent into Darkness</a>. Yet, we can not rely on depth identification - as evident by <a href="https://wiki.spiralknights.com/Refuge" target="_blank">Refuge</a> being at depth 28, above Core Terminal of depth 29. This and the multiple meaning of the Descend Into Darkness make it difficult to identify without relying on the subjective perception of themes.

##### The Dream

Now with that paradigm, we return to the question of the Dream - what it is, and then, where is the Swarm.

1. If the Dream is the white skydome of Sanctuary/Refuge, and the Swarm remains within the Core, seeping into the Clockworks, the Whitespace could be considered near Swarm's source as the Swarm can't reach the Sanctuary.

   But, we encounter a gameplay mechanic - the map. The map, compared to the <a href="https://wiki.spiralknights.com/Unknown_Passage" target="_blank">Unknown Passage</a>, is not obscured within the Core, as well as we do not observe <a href="https://wiki.spiralknights.com/The_Swarm#Swarm_Source" target="_blank">Swarm Sources</a> within the Whitespace of <a href="https://wiki.spiralknights.com/Dreams_and_Nightmares/A_Step_Beyond" target="_blank">A Step Beyond</a>.

   Swarm's concentration without Swarm Source reaches local high at <a href="https://wiki.spiralknights.com/Dreams_and_Nightmares/Descent_into_Darkness" target="_blank">Descent into Darkness</a>. There is a different question of: does this mean that the Swarm was sieging the Sanctuary/Refuge skydome, where the Sleeper is supposedly located?
   this seems as plausible explanation, which would also explain weakness of Sleeper and a possibility of Swarm expanding infinite. Weather seemingly infinite energy output of the Core, consumed by the Swarm, would make Sleeper weaker, currently is unknown, as we are unaware of Whitespace's exact composition.

2. Dream is the Core with Whitespace, Swarm is external.

   In that case we have a scenario, where Swarm and the Sleeper exist in-place together within a single Dream, as the "this" Dream stated to be unreachable by the Swarm, while it breaches the Core from the Clockworks, and mirrors itself within its space - mirroring itself within the Whitespace.

   This approach may seem less straightforward, considering Vaelyn, Kora, and Parma's dialogues, suggesting that the Swarm is in the Core. So we can suggest a following option.

   The Core and the Cradle are referred to as the World and the 'my dream', as Sleeper slept through construction of Clockworks or a dream of protection. Namely `VULNERABLE IN SLUMBER` means that it was not protected, until `WORLDS WERE DRAWN TO SHIELD ME FROM THE DARKNESS` - protected by Cradle and its worlds ([Echo Stone: Ironclaw Munitions Factory](https://wiki.spiralknights.com/Echo_Stone:_Ironclaw_Munitions_Factory)).

   Cradle was created to protect Sleeper. Where Vaelyn was right and [Echo Stone: Ironclaw Munitions Factory](https://wiki.spiralknights.com/Echo_Stone:_Ironclaw_Munitions_Factory) tell, it became a prison in a sense that the Sleeper was imprisoned at by Architect.

In that context, the Core being sealed is an act of imprisonment, but one suggested to be a short term solution, as due to presence of Swarm, now it is detrimental. Crimson Order at that seem to uphold this status quo by the fact of Herex's secrecy and his perception of them being the fault one.

The Core could not be built momentarily, as its physicality is of material realm. It would be part of protection originally build with the Cradle, but now the Core and the Cradle are a prison:

`IN HIS MADNESS, THE ARCHITECT BETRAYED THE PACT. TWISTING HIS CREATION INTO A GAME OF DEATH, IT NOW DEVOURS ALL WHO ENTER ITS IRON EMBRACE.` ([Echo Stone: Ironclaw Munitions Factory](https://wiki.spiralknights.com/Echo_Stone:_Ironclaw_Munitions_Factory))

The `IT` term in the [Echo Stone: Firestorm Citadel](https://wiki.spiralknights.com/Echo_Stone:_Firestorm_Citadel) - `AS I DREAMED, IT CONSUMED. ... IT GREW STRONGER, ENDLESSLY MIRRORING ITSELF WITHIN THE SPACE OF MY DREAM.` - makes it seem that the Swarm was getting stronger inside the the space which is occupied by or is the same as the dream - `THE SPACE OF MY DREAM`. It is plausible if we think of the Dream being not the Sanctuary, but on the contrary, the Core with its Whitespace contained - for example, a definition of a space under Sleeper's authority over matter. This idea ties to a the fact that Swarm was feeding on Core's energy, mirroring itself either within it - the Whitespace.

The term of mirroring if interpreted, would mean presence of mirrors in a confinement. Such confinement being the Whitespace within the Core. Or, if Dream's space being Cradle, the mirrorings would be then the Shadow Lairs. But as Sleeper is weaker, and refers to the dream as Sanctuary, we suggest that the Swarm's mirroring was also within the Core, as the endlessness of Whitespace and a concept of unlimited power source to feed upon.

- `WITHIN MY DREAM I SAW IT OPEN THE VOID, FELT ITS ENDLESS HUNGER.` (Echo Stone: Gloaming Wildwoods).
- `WITHIN MY DREAM I SEE YOUR LEGION FALLING TO THIS WORLD LIKE BURNING STARS.` (Echo Stone: Royal Jelly Palace).

Based on this we come to the following conclusions:

- The Sleeper is safe within the Sanctuary, his dream - a constructed skydome within Core's Whitespace, which initially was the totality of Whitespace, essentially being a volume of Sleeper's security.
- Whitespace itself is infinite and is the source of Energy. The space taken buy the Whitespace is surrounded by the Core to interact with it in controlled manner, as proven by presence of Consoles, with the Clockworks and to power them. Consoles are capable of opening Core's hatch when charged Artifact is inserted.
- The Sleeper is within the Sanctuary, as mentioned - constructed as a regular skydome of Clockworks for a reason, and an only place to contain grass and water, as well as exit from the Core.

From Core's sealed state, Sanctuary and entities within are capable of limited control over Core's operation, accessing Core internal space, as Parma managed to find an exit to the Refuge. An exit in that sense, from infinity of Whitespace, which as it got deeper, was the more occupied by the Swarm. Connection to the rest of Clockworks from within the Core would not be possible then, or at least by a small degree, as suggested by Whitespace blocks at Sanctuary elevator.

But the Core's sealed state does not mean the sleeping state of Sleeper, as it was already sleeping yet before Architect's betrayal, that is `VULNERABLE IN SLUMBER, WORLDS WERE DRAWN TO SHIELD ME FROM THE DARKNESS.` (Echo Stone: Ironclaw Munitions Factory). The Swarm feed of Whitespace, but once the Core was sealed, the Swarm was severed from it, which led it to breach it.

The Swarm was trapped within infinite Whitespace, while the external part managed to breach the Core and maintain itself, slowly expanding, as shown by movement of Unknown Passage in <a href="https://wiki.spiralknights.com/It_Came_From_Below" target="_blank">It Came From Below</a>.

##### The Pact

It is implied that gremlins had an assistance in building Clockworks. As in Whitespace it was seen to be possible to manifest matter, and, potentially, Divine Clockwork tunnels, based of its transition into the abstract. Would this mean that the concept of Swarm mirroring itself is Sleeper's term for not specifically multiplication, but creation? As it is the only instance of Swarm gaining power with the exactness of the method it gains it, we suggest it being the metaphor for creation.

`WHAT IT WAS BEFORE IT IS NO MORE. NEITHER BEAST NOR GOD, IT IS A CREATION UNLIKE ALL.` (Echo Stone: Firestorm Citadel).

This establishes a state preceding the current one. The term Creation will be looked at shortly.

The Swarm source within the Core was, while sealed, expanding with the direct access to the energy of the Core/Whitespace. In that interpretation, the Swarm on the outside would attempt entering itself, as it requires Energy to sustain itself. There is a possibility of that somebody intersecting into a relation of Swarm within the Whitespace and Sleeper, as it is told by Sleeper: `IT KNOWS OF YOU NOW. IT WILL FIND A WAY OUT AND COME FOR YOU` (Echo Stone: Gloaming Wildwoods), but it may also be a consequence of attempting to enter the Core by anybody except the Swarm as a potential threat to its plan to escape the Core, as well as a potential foreshadowing of its raising activity in <a href="https://wiki.spiralknights.com/It_Came_From_Below" target="_blank">It Came From Below</a>, prior to activation of the second console.

With this theory we found at least one loose end: if the Whitespace is under control of the Swarm, while the Sanctuary hadn't already fallen? Yet we observe its exterior - one behind the skydome, - as pure white. Could the be another consequence of Whitespace being infinite within the Core?

`IN HIS MADNESS, THE ARCHITECT BETRAYED THE PACT.` (Echo Stone: Ironclaw Munitions Factory)

The Pact between the Sleeper and the Architect is struck. Betrayal of the Pact resulted in the current status quo of Core being Sealed, with `THIS WORLD HAS BECOME MY PRISON.` and `TWISTING HIS CREATION INTO A GAME OF DEATH, IT NOW DEVOURS ALL WHO ENTER ITS IRON EMBRACE.` (Echo Stone: Ironclaw Munitions Factory)

based on this we can gather, that the Pact had involved transformation of creation of Cradle into a mechanized fortress. Gremlins would inhabit and, at least, maintain its defenses.

We suggest it also being form Gremlins' perspective known as the Iron Law, due to its significance to Herex: `The Iron Law is Broken` (<a href="https://wiki.spiralknights.com/Hidden_Hideout" target="_blank">Spark and Roar - Hidden Hideout - Herex</a>). This state of brokenness is characterized by supposed falsehood of Crimson Order: `The Crimson Order is False! The Nine are blind, they cannot see the Truth that lies below. The Nine are deaf, they cannot hear the Resonance that beats within this world` (<a href="https://wiki.spiralknights.com/Hidden_Hideout" target="_blank">Spark and Roar - Hidden Hideout - Herex</a>).

By that, maintenance of the Pact, of ones upholding it - the Crimson Order, - is an incorrect position. The Truth and the Resonance could be referring to anything that comprises the Core - as it is called the heart of the World, - be it the Swarm, Whitespace, or the Sleeper.

The current condition of Cradle is one of broken Iron Law from Herex's perspective, and of broken Pact from the perspective of Sleeper, with the Core being currently sealed as a measure. And yet, the Core must be kept sealed for the Swarm not to escape.

We suggest a plausible explanation, which allows to resolve those conflicts - Iron Law is the idea of Core remaining sealed - a crisis-control measure to prevent Swarm from escaping, - as Crimson Oder supposedly did hide the Artifact prior to Skylark crash landing.

Through connections:

- `TWISTING HIS CREATION INTO A GAME OF DEATH, IT NOW DEVOURS ALL WHO ENTER ITS IRON EMBRACE.` (Echo Stone: Ironclaw Munitions Factory).
- `WITHIN MY DREAM I SAW IT OPEN THE VOID, FELT ITS ENDLESS HUNGER.` (Echo Stone: Gloaming Wildwoods).

We suggest that the Sleeper was sleeping during the Pact breakage, as shields were drawn, and Cradle constructed. And as it was broken, the Swarm or rather the entity before it, if we consider it as `IT`, `opened the void`, and was consumed by it. As a result, it then hungered for everything, including Core's energy in a way, which had to be taken care of: `IT GREW STRONGER, ENDLESSLY MIRRORING ITSELF WITHIN THE SPACE OF MY DREAM. ENDLESSLY MIRRORING... EXPANDING... INFINITE.` (Echo Stone: Firestorm Citadel). And, through this affliction by the void and its hunger it came to its the current physicality: `WHAT IT WAS BEFORE IT IS NO MORE. NEITHER BEAST NOR GOD, IT IS A CREATION UNLIKE ALL.` (Echo Stone: Firestorm Citadel).

It was transformed into the malevolent entity, as no danger prior to it, apart from abstract darkness, was present, - not within the `WORLDS WERE DRAWN TO SHIELD ME FROM THE DARKNESS.` (Echo Stone: Ironclaw Munitions Factory) At that, the Iron Law can be related to Sleeper's term of Iron Prison as Cradle and the Core, but mirroring its meaning.

Through this logic, we can propose, tha the entity suspected to help construct the Clockworks is the initial, non-malevolent precursor of the Swarm, shared with the Whitespace by the fact of rectangular, similar, abstract design - we wll return to ths design in the context of the Void and its effects. Within this thought framework, it would mean that the Swarm found in the Shadow Lairs is the part of greater whole, sealed in the Core, essentially of the nature of Whitespace.

The scenario of the Core had to be sealed seem to be the case of a temporary solution, which, while allowing to contain the Swarm, imprisoned with it Sleeper itself, if we interpret the words `IT GREW STRONGER, ENDLESSLY MIRRORING ITSELF WITHIN THE SPACE OF MY DREAM. ENDLESSLY MIRRORING... EXPANDING... INFINITE.` (Echo Stone: Firestorm Citadel), paired with the Dream being the volume of the Core, as a sign of is being within the Core.

##### The Void: Part 2

For the first time alchemical motif was introduced in the general analysis of the [Nameless Realm](#nameless-realm) as it had its dual nature of chaos and elements converging in the same manner as the alchemical primordial chaos of the First Matter, also introduced there and then as the Round Chaos of Mercurius - [expanded](#alchemical-symbolism-of-shadow-lairs-great-work-and-rebis) in the symbolic relation to Shadow Lairs.

The Void is encountered physically once - as the identity of shadow enemies emerging from Swarm portals. The death of those entities signs at their distinct metaphysics, separate from the material realm.

We can suggest, that some aspect of either Void or Whitespace is responsible for this ability either to influence - consume, - or to completely replicate living beings. We are not aware, weather this ability undeniably belongs to he Void, as covered in [Divine and Whitespace Clockworks](#divine-and-whitespace-clockworks), it seems that Whitespace is capable of manufacturing the tunnels, unless those are depicted as consumed by Whitespaces, being abstracted away. This concept can be plausible in Theory of Forms, brought to the fundamental Form within the "higher" realm of Whitespace or further beyond, serving its distinct purpose of transporting from point A to point B.

On the other hand, within our earlier logic, entity of Whitespace had to be that form of assistance during Clockworks' construction. Here we would argue for Whitespace and Nameless realm being close, but due to how Whitespace is depicted as ordered and likely with a relation to the divine, we can't state this, unless, they are related as Underworld and Blinding Abyss by being metaphysically nearby each other.

If Whitespace itself is incapable of creating tunnels from Whitespace we have more arguments in favour of the Void being the alchemical Void. Before further analysis we will elaborate on the alchemical meaning of the Void, as one being of the same nature as First Matter. In that context it is known as the Round Chaos ("Psychology and Alchemy" - Carl Jung):

<BookCitation source="Psychology and Alchemy - Carl Jung">

`The prima materia has the quality of ubiquity: it can be found always and everywhere, which is to say that projection can take place always and everywhere. The English alchemist Sir George Ripley writes: “The philosophers tell the inquirer that birds and fishes bring us the lapis, every man has it, it is in every place, in you, in me, in everything, in time and space.” “It offers itself in lowly form [vili figura]. From it there springs our eternal water [aqua permanens].” According to Ripley the prima materia is water; it is the material principle of all bodies, including mercury. It is the hyle which the divine act of creation brought forth from the chaos as a dark sphere. The chaos is a massa confusa that gives birth to the stone. The hylical water contains a hidden elemental fire. In the treatise “De sulphure” hell-fire (ignis gehennalis) is attributed to the element earth as its inner opposite. According to Hortulanus, the stone arises from a massa confusa containing in itself all the elements. Just as the world came forth from a chaos confusum, so does the stone. The idea of the rotating aquasphere reminds us of the Neopythagoreans: in Archytas the world-soul is a circle or sphere; in Philolaos it draws the world round with it in its rotation. The original idea is to be found in Anaxagoras, where the nous gives rise to a whirlpool in chaos. The cosmogony of Empedokles is also relevant: here the σϕαīρος (spherical being) springs from the union of dissimilars, owing to the influence of ϕιλία. The definition of this spherical being as , “the most serene God,” sheds a special light on the perfect, “round” nature of the lapis, which arises from, and constitutes, the primal sphere; hence the prima materia is often called lapis. The initial state is the hidden state, but by the art and the grace of God it can be transmuted into the second, manifest state. ... It is the black, magically fecund earth that Adam took with him from Paradise, also called antimony and described as a “black blacker than black” (nigrum nigrius nigro).`

Form this emerges a concept of god Mercurius, standing on the round chaos, or, the void. Form this a following adia can be established: The Void of Spiral Knghts is the alchemical Void, equalling the round Chaos. Then, it has similar nature to the Nameless Realm, as both represent First Matter in different perspectives. Moreover, both realms are related to [evil eye]() symbolism.

- In relation to the Nameless Realm, [Chaos Cloak]() encompasses curse, whish is the one of pillars of the evil eye symbolism across Cradle, - as one of elements within Nameless Realm. The Cloak has a depicted an antique evil eye on its front.
- In relation to the Void, eye symbolism is present within the Swarm, most prominently on the symvology of Shadow Lair elveators and the Swarm entity.

Nameless Realm and the Void are both framed in a similar, dangerous, manner:

- the mantle - Chaos Cloak, - is forbidden across Owlites: `A forbidden mantle said to grant the wearer protection within the nameless realm where all elements are said to converge into one and divide into all.` (<a href="https://wiki.spiralknights.com/Chaos_Cloak" target="_blank">Chaos Cloak</a>).
- The Void has hunger, which can be felt by one "opening" it, in our case it is the entity which eventually became the Swarm: `WITHIN MY DREAM I SAW IT OPEN THE VOID, FELT ITS ENDLESS HUNGER.` ([Echo Stone: Gloaming Wildwoods](https://wiki.spiralknights.com/Echo_Stone:_Gloaming_Wildwoods)).

We will focus on this concept of opening the Void and of hunger in mind and attempt to understand it in two steps. First, we will adhere to the idea of the Void being of similar nature to the alchemical Void, - the themes and concepts of this justification will be introduces throughout this section, where they seem to be thematicallyfitting and make relatively reasonable, mostly symbolic, connections. Then, we will attempt to interpret whose findings within the context of Spiral Knights cosmology. The third steps consistes of the aligning those concepts with the real-world mythology in order to find matching narratives or other patterns.

<!-- As round chaos precedes creation of gold, which is considered a divine metal, gold keys' designs as golden mineral shards within Whitespace may be a color-coded hint, as if both Void and Whitespace represented the beginning and the end of the Great Work. -->

It seems that the Void is one potential catalyst for the transpiring events, relating to `IN HIS MADNESS, THE ARCHITECT BETRAYED THE PACT.` (Echo Stone: Ironclaw Munitions Factory).

The alchemical Void is the Prime Matter, from which, through alchemical transmutation, anything can be created by the alchemist. Here, most of material realm entities - enemies, - are connected to this potential void by Swarm dur to their presence in the [Unknown Passage]() and other infested by the Swarm Clockwork depths, and the Core. This connection stems from the fact that those entities seemingly are, by the time they are found, possess this void-like or Swarm-like nature, are called as such, and on death perish in the same manner as other Swarm-related entities. This could be either a case of Swarm consuming and transforming living entities from Clockworks, or a case of Swarm creating them in the image of the consumed originals.

As for the first scenario, we can assume that Swarm is unable to consume perished entities, judging of the gremlins in the beginning of the Unknonw Passage. The second scenraion is still physically possible, and potentially exists due to the term used by the Sleeper in relation to Swarm's expansion: `IT GREW STRONGER, ENDLESSLY MIRRORING ITSELF WITHIN THE SPACE OF MY DREAM.`

Alchemical Void has a chaotic aspect, which was closely similar to the chaos of <a href="https://wiki.spiralknights.com/Dark_Matter#Dark_Matter" target="_blank">Dark matter</a>: `dark and ominous in color said to contain the essences of both chaos and nothingness`. Then there is the instinctive intent of hunger - the hunger of the void: `IT OPEN THE VOID, FELT ITS ENDLESS HUNGER` (Echo Stone: Gloaming Wildwoods). This hunger is attributed to the void as if it was Void's integral property.

##### The Void: Part 3

It is implied that the Swarm originated with Architect's maddening betrayal, and as discussed earlier, themes of hunger are present here, as in:

- `WITHIN MY DREAM I SAW IT OPEN THE VOID, FELT ITS ENDLESS HUNGER.` [Echo Stone: Gloaming Wildwoods](). It corresponds directly to the Void, and potentially Swarm, as it felt the hunger.
- `TWISTING HIS CREATION INTO A GAME OF DEATH, IT NOW DEVOURS ALL WHO ENTER ITS IRON EMBRACE.` [Echo Stone: Ironclaw Munitions Factory](). If coupled with the previous idea, then it is the Swarm which devours, apart fom Clockworks themselves.
- The name of second depth of [It Came From Below]() - [`Into the Maw`]() - is a direct metaphor on the entrance to the Unknown Passage, as it is the first direct encounter with the Swarm across rank missions. This establishes a metaphor of the Swarm being a beast, into whose maw knights descend.
- Earlier organic themes of the Core, covered in the [Core Terminal section](#core-terminal), identifying it to the nerve center - as Vaelyn: `asd`, and a heart - as Sleeper: `asd`.

It is suggested, that Cradle itself was twisted, or changed, to devour everything. Cradle is creation of Architect, who is implied gremlin king (`Tinkinzar is said to be a great ruler and mechanical genius, responsible for the vision of the whole Clockworks.` <a href="https://wiki.spiralknights.com/Bootshuze" target="_blank">Bootshuze</a>).

-`IN HIS MADNESS, THE ARCHITECT BETRAYED THE PACT.` (Echo Stone: Ironclaw Munitions Factory)

- `THIS WORLD WAS CREATED TO PROTECT ME. VULNERABLE IN SLUMBER, WORLDS WERE DRAWN TO SHIELD ME FROM THE DARKNESS.` (Echo Stone: Ironclaw Munitions Factory)
- `I've felt it since we first set foot on this world; invisible eyes watching our every move, shapes that form just out of view... something greater than gremlins calls this world home.` (<a href="https://wiki.spiralknights.com/The_Search_Continues" target="_blank">The Search Continues - Vaelyn</a>)
- `The Core that we seek, there's something truly dreadful about it. I know that it may very well be what gets us home, but I can't shake this feeling that we've been thinking about it all wrong. ... I mean that the Core isn't a big battery that runs this world, but rather it and the whole of this world is a massive prison designed to keep something from ever leaving. Think about our geo-scans of Cradle just before the crash- they show it as being composed of hundreds of massive slabs of other worlds, almost like plates of armor. Then you have the Clockworks, the most unnatural thing I've ever seen. An entire world whose sole purpose seems to be stopping anyone from ever reaching its Core.` (<a href="https://wiki.spiralknights.com/Becoming_a_Champion" target="_blank">Becoming a Champion - Feron</a>)

This follows the idea of the Swarm being a later occurrence, while Cradle was indeed made to shield from the darkness, the Sleeper has told of, and, by the event, covered in the Pact, Cradle became a prison to contain and seal the Swarm near and within the Core by th e act of keeping the Core sealed.

And yet, it is unknown, weather this darkness, the Swarm, and the Void are the same. But, we can to assume those being such, as this creates means for the narrative to be fulfilled, - that the Void is darkness, unless it was an unexpected event. The idea of the Void, or at least the Swarm being this darkness, we believe, stems from the idea of descending into beast's maw, a descend into darkness, while the knights are compared to the light, as stars, whose fire is intended to be kept: `WITHIN MY DREAM I SEE YOUR LEGION FALLING TO THIS WORLD LIKE BURNING STARS. YOU FALL WITH PURPOSE, BURNING EVER BRIGHTER AS YOU REACH FOR THE HEART OF THIS WORLD. HOLD DEARLY THIS FIRE IN YOU, FOR DARKNESS WILL CONSUME ALL THE NIGHT IF ITS STARS BEGIN TO FADE.` (Echo Stone: Royal Jelly Palace). Here, it is also established that the darkness is yet to come, as stars are fading in the Clockworks, where in Swarm is located. This would not directly mean, that the Void and the Swarm are also the darkness, as Sleeper's metaphors omit much of details in regards to the main actors and dangers - that is darkness is everything endangering Sleeper. But, this would seem fitting, as Sleeper is in the Whitespace, an opposite of darkness by its design.

The madness is followed by betrayal and opening of the Void by supposedly non-malevolent Swarm are connected. What is the reason behind this maddening affliction?

It seems that the Clockworks were completed by the time the king went mad, so something happened after the completion of the Clockworks, but before the Core was sealed and Architect going mad, - something which was not expected by the `mechanical genius`, which had to live through entirety of Clockworks construction, if we take this concept of the king as a living being rather than an ide created by Crimson Order.

This would likely being near same period Tinkinzar had disappeared, as we have discussed on Pakrat speaking of the king as if he saw him: `Tinkinzar not seen for many many years. Crimson Order carries out Tinkinzar's plans for Cradle. Emberlight was blight on master plan because built by outcasts. Haven was probably the same, founded by non-Gremlins` (<a href="https://wiki.spiralknights.com/Pakrat#Dialogue" target="_blank">Pakrat</a>). With the consideration of the idea of a king being a only a concept, as [previously suggested](#king-tinkinzar), we can assume, that Crimson Order took reigns after king's maddening affliction.

This property of hunger of the void seemingly was inherited by the Swarm as stated: `IT DEVOURED THE KNOWLEDGE OF TIME... MEMORIES OF THE DEAD... THE HEARTS OF KINGS AND THE SOULS OF THEIR PEOPLE... GOOD AND EVIL... IT CONSUMED.` (Echo Stone: Firestorm Citadel), as the capacity of the Void is unknown, while the Swarms is perceived by Sleeper as of the greatest danger, yet, different from the original darkness:

- `THIS WORLD WAS CREATED TO PROTECT ME. VULNERABLE IN SLUMBER, WORLDS WERE DRAWN TO SHIELD ME FROM THE DARKNESS.` ([Echo Stone: Ironclaw Munitions Factory]()).
- `WHAT IT WAS BEFORE IT IS NO MORE. NEITHER BEAST NOR GOD, IT IS A CREATION UNLIKE ALL.` ([Echo Stone: Firestorm Citadel]()). We will include it here, as those 2 elements could be the "parents" of its origin, as they are mentioned here.
- `YOU FALL WITH PURPOSE, BURNING EVER BRIGHTER AS YOU REACH FOR THE HEART OF THIS WORLD. HOLD DEARLY THIS FIRE IN YOU, FOR DARKNESS WILL CONSUME ALL THE NIGHT IF ITS STARS BEGIN TO FADE.` ([Echo Stone: Royal Jelly Palace]()).

Hunger is related to animalistic motif present across Black Kats, as those are also related to the theme of hunger and darkness: `These shadowy beasts hunger for arcane power and raided the Moorcroft Manor Archives' precious collection of magical grimoires` (<a href="https://wiki.spiralknights.com/Kataclysmic_Confrontation" target="_blank">Kataclysmic Confrontation</a>). We have covered Black Kats [earlier](). It does seem that the erasure of Kat tribe by Kataclysm, or their banishment to Underworld, had also affected them in their post-mortem state. They search for Owlite tomes even if reincarnated as battle sprites. We had attributed this to both spirits returning from material realm and Core's metaphysic presence, through which spirit can return literally through reincarnation in battle sprites.

One more particularity of Owlites is the fact that their tome - the Book of Grey Feathers,- was the cause of Kataclysm. We can suggest that the Book is connected to the Nameless Realm as both researched by Owlites. It would be a new discovery, if entities and objects connected to the Nameless Realm can cause a creation of a rift into the Underworld and change physicality of affected entities. Could it be, that the event of opening the void was similar to Kataclysm? If so, why there is no shadow damage in the Swarm-native entities, as they would be affected by it, or by curse from Underworld. The latter, at that, is a different question, but the general possibility of those 2 events being the same in nature can be a potential path the setting could be aiming for.

`IT DEVOURED THE KNOWLEDGE OF TIME... MEMORIES OF THE DEAD... THE HEARTS OF KINGS AND THE SOULS OF THEIR PEOPLE... GOOD AND EVIL... IT CONSUMED.` (Echo Stone: Firestorm Citadel)

Swarm's hunger, compared to Black Kats' hunger, is metaphysical, as it transcends matter, given Sleeper's metaphors

- `THE HEARTS OF KINGS AND THE SOULS OF THEIR PEOPLE`

  Other than Almire, there are no kingdoms. The fact that this quote was presented after Shadow Firestorm Citadel, seems as an intentional design choice.

  If we develop further this idea, then the transformation of Lord Vanaduke through curse, as if his heart was consumed, then souls of king's people is, likely, the state they are found - the Legion of Almire of undead, including cursed Carnavons. As all are classified as undead, and the fiery souls are released only by the time Lord Vanaduke is defeated and the Citadel start to crumble due to lack of `an eternal will` to keep it persisting, it can be a potential theme to link both undeath and Swarm.

  The other possibility is the Shadow Firestorm Citadel, which is connected to the Swarm by its presence in the Throne Room and the general location of this Citadel in the Shadow Lairs.

  If so, Darkfire Vanaduke would remain as a single king, whose heart was consumed by a more commonly known curse. The rest of his people - their souls - would be consumed by the fact of curse afflicting them - as Carnavons.

  We should state, that, so far this theme is only taken from the context of Almire.

- `THE KNOWLEDGE OF TIME`

  The knowledge of time could be interpreted as removal of any elements through which a chronology could be reconstructed, which is partially due to nature of Cradle.

  This interpretation can also be applied to Owlites, as those did document everything around them, even a long past kingdom of Almire. So then the fact Kataclysm, stemming seemingly from dual nature of Nameless Realm, which Owlites did stud, may be a symbolic way of saying them being erased.

- `MEMORIES OF THE DEAD`

  Based of the earlier analysis of the metaphysical state Cradle is found, as one where spirits return to material realm, we stopped at 2 potential sources of this change: The Core and Kataclysm.

  We have proposed that the Core had to be that phenomenon, as Kataclysm had to happen before Owlite Academy was incorporated into Cradle, and by nature of Void Souls, within the Core. As other instances of lost souls were connected to the Underworld and those metaphysics, we argued that the Core creates the condition for lost souls, yet consumed by the Swarm, to emerge even in the physical condition of Whitespace, albeit it allows for regular matter to exist, despite its general abstracted, alien design.

  In this interpretation the Swarm has a transcendental nature of Whitespace as a major component, - despite environment of Whitespace, Swarm has the capacity to influence and manipulate Lost Souls, as Void Souls.

  We may consider consumption of memories of the dead as related to Swarm's ability to create void enemies, from of through the consumption of souls. It is often though in folklore and spirituality, that loss of memories was related to a fragmented state of one's soul, so, with consideration of previous motifs, and here with notion of affecting souls, this can be viewed through such lens.

  While existence of Whitespace is one responsible for a shift in metaphysical boundaries, the Swarm, if it is to be one of Whitespace's origins, also has this ability. If the Swarm is not of Whitespace origin, but rather becoming as such in design due to draining Core's energy, then it is nature of the Void which grants this soul-manipulating capability.

- `GOOD AND EVIL`

  As if the hunger of the void extended beyond those concepts, we can suggest it being a metaphor not black and white morality, but total erasure of those concepts from the rest of the world, through their consumption, - the idea similar to nihilism.

  Another way to interpret this quote is rely on the Lovecraftian themes of eldritch entities - by that we mean that for them, concepts of good and evil do not exist. We see this argument as one fitting here, as th Swarm and the entire Herex plot line frames the Swarm and an eldritch entity, albeit an artificial one with a primordial component of the Void.

  This notion is similar to Apocrea, as it is also inspired by Lovecraftian Mythology. As Apocrea exists through souls, we can suggest, that it and th Void are also connected by the fact of capacity to directly interact with souls, as discussed in the [Apocrean Engines](#apocrean-engines) and [analysis of Apocrean Realm](#analysis-of-apocrean-realm).

From this we can gather that either due to influence of the Void, of due to Whitespace, Swarm is capable manipulating souls. Sleeper places the Swarm as onr capable of consuming everything in interpretations described above, while we link those to events of Cradle, which had to happen far before Sleeper was imprisoned. This comes down to a narrative, which we earlier discussed as darkness can be considered anything of the cases above, while the Swarm may represent it metaphorically, or, as souls are introduced, physically.

The physical connection then should stem from a different nature, rather than Underworld, while it was the main reason behind the downfall of most of the civilizations, presence of the Swarm expands it.

An idea of a relation now of for souls and hunger may be found in the themes of Apocrea and Kats:

- `Though you may venture beyond this nexus, you will undoubtedly fall into one of their traps along the way. The Apocrea bend reality, twisting the environment they invade into a trap. In these traps they stalk any life, harvesting their souls for some unimaginable purpose` (<a href="https://wiki.spiralknights.com/Apocrean_Harvester" target="_blank">The Obsidian Nexus</a>).
- `These shadowy beasts hunger for arcane power and raided the Moorcroft Manor Archives' precious collection of magical grimoires` (<a href="https://wiki.spiralknights.com/Kataclysmic_Confrontation" target="_blank">Kataclysmic Confrontation</a>).

As those two cases also are connected to nature of souls, we have to keep the in mind in case of a different common motif to be found.

The way Sleeper's quotes are interpreted has also ties with the thematic parity of Shadow Lairs' and themes of Echo Stones:

- [Echo Stone: Gloaming Wildwoods](https://wiki.spiralknights.com/Echo_Stone:_Gloaming_Wildwoods) speaks of Swarm as one to possess bestial features, which is similar to how Snarbolax is described: `Be advised that Recon Knights have reported the presence of a terrible beast the likes of which we have not seen before stalking this forest. Known as 'the Snarbolax,' it appears as a shadowy mass of fangs and claws and seems completely immune to our weaponry. Should you encounter it, try and find a means of escape as fast as possible` (<a href="https://wiki.spiralknights.com/Shadow_of_the_Beast" target="_blank">Shadow of the Beast</a>).
- [Echo Stone: Royal Jelly Palace](https://wiki.spiralknights.com/Echo_Stone:_Royal_Jelly_Palace) speaks of Isorians as aliens falling onto Cradle with purpose, which is similar to how slimes arrived, from whom ice Queen is derived. Other than that, we don't think this has any relation to further engineering performed on slimes, lichens specifically.
- [Echo Stone: Ironclaw Munitions Factory](https://wiki.spiralknights.com/Echo_Stone:_Ironclaw_Munitions_Factory) speaks of Cradle as gremlin creation after the gremlin facility - Shadow Ironclaw Munitions Factory, - was traversed.
- [Echo Stone: Firestorm Citadel](https://wiki.spiralknights.com/Echo_Stone:_Firestorm_Citadel) seemingly contains the same motif as one suggested in the context of Great Work in the [symbolic analysis](#alchemical-symbolism-of-shadow-lairs-great-work-and-rebis) of shadow lairs, as it brings conclusion to all of the above elements in fire, as if the Citadel was the fiery crucible.

  In case of Echo Stones it had shown the extent of Swarm's influence through connection to kings - essentially Almire, - and then giving it a name. In case of Maiden's Tear, it a symbolic element of completeness of the spiritual Work manifested as a capacity to traverse Shadow Lairs and eagerness to withstand them as the demonstration of the Swarm's extent of power. And yet, all of those motifs seem to converge in this vague pair of themes of wildness, hunger, and of darkness or shadows, with allusion to chaos.

Considering all of this, it seems to us by the fact that all of those concepts being vaguely connected, that we are missing a core element to this narrative, which would bridge the gap between nature of the Swarm, Void and the rest of existence.

We think it is the space for curse to exit, as it is the only concept which could come close to be tht diverse to be inexplicable if it affected a different physics - an idea we proposed in the end of the intermediate analysis of curse, but, for now, we don't have other arguments for it to be definitively be the component, which had resulted in the Swarm as it is. But, we have to work with what we have, and from this we suggest now for looking into a different part of the narrative.

Opening of the Void still requires a will or an intent, as it was a direct action, one, we believe, to be related to Architect's madness and betrayal. As the most present theme here is of the parity of hunger and darkness, we are to revisit description of shadow damage: `Shadow damage is generally caused by concentrations of negative energy. Attacks that inflict shadow damage include anything from the psychic manipulation of the aforementioned negative energy to physical attacks using weapons forged from dark matter.` (<a href="https://wiki.spiralknights.com/The_Shadow_Knows" target="_blank">The Shadow Knows - Hahn</a>), which is by itself is an assault on the sentience, as, by proxy, dark matter: `A fabled mineral dark and ominous in color said to contain the essences of both chaos and nothingness`. Shadows is also the term Alpha Squad refers to the Swarm: `We are at the end of the line. Pursued by some kind of terrible darkness we are forced into the unknown. As we neared the Core- I don't know how to describe this really... the shadows came alive and began to attack us. Rulen became enveloped in it and by the time Grantz freed him his body was badly burned. He said it felt like both fire and ice` ([Recon Module: Entrance to the Core - Parma](https://wiki.spiralknights.com/Recon_Module)) as well as the the term of <a href="https://wiki.spiralknights.com/Release_Notes_2011-10-19" target="_blank">Shadows Falling Over Cradle</a>, but, now we know that those are on the surface distinct entities visually and thematically. This is also a prime example of the large portion of this analysis existing due to unreliability of its many narrators.

We can compare the dual nature of the Void and Whitespace as candidates for Prime Matter, but also, Whitespace as the Nameless Realm and the Void. First it is that chaos both of the alchemical Void and of Nameless Realm exist, - one symbolic and unseen and one physical and confirmed.

Whitespace is related to divinity and seemingly meant to exist on a different plane rather than material realm to to how alien it is, and as it was encapsulated into the artificial Core, as heavenly kingdom did, existing in an air of divine, while paralleling, as we pointed out, the [myth of the Celestial Kingdom](#celestial-kingdom). It seems as if metaphysically Whitespace is the closest thing to a divine realm across of all dimensions of the established cosmology.

Thematic characteristics of Whitespace as divine can be further affirmed by the naming convention of Orbs of Alchemy and Fire Crystals, as Eternal Orbs of Alchemy and Radiant Fire Crystals. At least the latter is related to the accumulation of the energy - heat - by the presence of the Core. Fire Crystals have similar inner glow as orbs of alchemy. Apart from those similarities, heat is present both as an floating essence, a life force of enemies as they leave it metaphorically, or as fire crystals. As with the energy and souls, we suggest, heat is of the same in nature, a form Energy takes form, as it can be collected to crystals under the same principle as [minerals containing energy](#minerals-and-souls-part-1).

In that regard, Nameless Realm in particular is the only other candidate for divinity, as it was discovered and forbidden by Owlites, which had a relation to the heavenly kingdom of valkyries. And yet, it seems as if heavenly kingdom was not in a different realm, at least not in one forbidding existence of regular matter, as its inhabitants were called celestial beings, in similar manner to the celestial attribute of Isorians. So, some definition of a "celestial" does exist. For now we don't know exactly, weather there is Nameless Realm beyond Whitespace, but we know that for deific entities such as Sleeper and Spirit Mother some location physical or metaphysical should exist, and this place is seemingly outside of material realm.

One notable element, relating to heavenly kingdom and its potential inspirations is that [Celestial Kingdom of Taoist](#celestial-kingdom), as while it was divine, it still requires Four Heavenly Kings or Guardians to protect it. Due to this, the Void and Nameless Realm are similar to different perspectives of chaos, while Whitespace if divine and Sleeper, an entity of this real, is still vulnerable, and prior two are meant to represent the opposites, as we initially proposed through a [vertical flow of souls as energy](#the-metaphysical-stack). The symbolic meaning of the Void in parity with hunger, which will be covered soon, also suggests, that it is indeed a location, from which all of matter originates, leaving Nameless Realm ambiguous.

The hunger is an essential element of its duality represented by an organic aspect to an existing mechanical and eternal of Whitespace entities, which are vulnerable to darkness, such as Sleeper. The only darkness capable of existing in many different forms, yet united through the share of dealing shadow damage, is the darkness of Underworld, also present in material realm as curse. Yet, Swarm itself deals normal damage. It can be potentially explained by the alchemical nature of the Void and Nameless Realm as containing all as Prime Matter, that including the curse as it was present in Chaos Clock.

##### The Void: Part 4

`WHAT IT WAS BEFORE IT IS NO MORE. NEITHER BEAST NOR GOD, IT IS A CREATION UNLIKE ALL.` (Echo Stone: Firestorm Citadel)

We can interpret it in more distinct manner: the Void is the beast and hunger, and God is the nature of Whitespace as divine. The creation unlike, yet being none of both, in the alchemical interpretation would be what divine Rebis could be - a unity of opposites, and here it seems to be a failed instance, one consumed by the hunger of the void.

An earlier case of Tinkinzar being Red King and Spirit Mother the White Queen could be a symbolic link, as if Tinkinzar was the representation of the material, the Clockworks and everything around the Core, worldly, and Spirit Mother as the divine, one associated with the divinity and themes of nature in the context of Almire.

We assume that the Swarm had taken qualities of the Void, after it was influenced by it. And, it was capable of feeding on Core's energy. If it was of Whitespace origin, it would explain its ability to directly interact with the Whitespace, or, as if Whitespace and the Void were of similar underlying nature.

Essentially, it comes down to the interpretation of the **hunger of the Void**, which was felt by a non-corrupt entity to become the Swarm. It is then the Void which corrupts, if we disregard the curse motif, present until this point in the analysis of metaphysics.

As there are no instances of the Void, we can attempt to connect it to the curse. But, now it has its own themes: it indeed does change physics of affected, cursed, entities [as far as we have discussed](#intermission), but Swarm only has characteristic normal damage, which is a requirement by now for curse to be consistently present. We have explained nature of normal damage as one attained by the alchemical equilibrium by relating to Prime Matter, but, this so far it seems as a logical leap. Could than the curse be still prevalent while chaos of the Void negates it?

Here Chaos Cloak is important, as it includes curse and has its symbolism, - as it is connected to Nameless Realm. It is clear that the Void and Nameless Realm are thematically different but mechanically the same interpretation of the concept of alchemical Prime Matter. And, as Nameless Realm is similar to the Void, we can assume that the curse also "dissolves" in the Void, as both represent this chaos. This can be a feasible interpretation.

More connection can be drawn from the design of locked enemy gates - as mentioned in the [Divine and Whitespace Clockworks](#divine-and-whitespace-clockworks), the enemy gates are marked by deep purple eye, which seems us as point of connection of curse and Whitespace, apart from being foreshadowed in the <a href="https://wiki.spiralknights.com/File:SpiralKnights_News_30.png" target="_blank">promotional art</a>.

A 2-color quality is found here, as Swarm is characterized by the black and pink - purple in Whitespace, while Whitespace is white, accompanied by gold.

Through this we can bring Swarm's nature, as well as a distinguished nature of the Void to 3 essentials:

- [Whitespace](#divine-and-whitespace-clockworks) represents order, divinity, godhood, and blessing, by proxy of [Spirit Mother](#almire-and-spirit-mother), Sleeper, and contrasts to the Swarm themes. It is light, with colors of white and gold.
- The Void is chaos, hunger, and beast. It is metaphorical darkness, described as shadows, and literal blackness. Through the Swarm, its colors are a lack of them and accent on pink.
- A [color-coded symbolic association to curse](#intermission-analysis-of-curse) as the evil eye looking down. Within this theory, the third essential in the curse, potentially negated by Prime Matter, or the Void. It is the only component so far possessing a color of dark red and purple or pink, and the most ambiguous in its application in the context of Swarms conception.

##### The Void: Part 5

Here, the Void and Nameless Realm are the dual interpretations of Prime Matter and its paradoxical nature, one of darkness and wildness, opposed by the order of Whitespace.

This notion could be similar to the Void in the teachings of Godai, wherein it represents a concept of Heaven, Ether, Space, Center, and Void, which, in consideration of the motif of [Celestial Kingdom](#celestial-kingdom) might be close to the real identity of the Void within Spiral Knights. This idea also is similar to the the concept of voidness in Buddhism, of Sunyata, the ultimate reality, but, as the concepts from alchemy persists, we lean rather to their's interpretation of the Void as the Prime Matter, with an addition of the wild, instinctive, aspect of hunger.

Now for the symbolic element of hunger and void. What we believe to be the foundation for the further work to be done in understanding of the Void and hunger is the ongoing motif of parity of hunger and the Void.

This theme is of the same nature as an established motif, which is found across mythology and folklore - of **paradoxical emptiness of the Void, from which the World was formed** in the according creation myth, such as _Wu Chi of Taoist_, the _Genesis of Christian Theology_, as _Chaos of Greek mythology_, and _Ginnungagap of Norse mythology_, and as _Sunyata of Buddhism_.

Due to this, we can make a guess, that the hunger in question, while has this paradoxical relation to the Void, marks the Void as the real origin of the Universe in Spiral Knights. If the Void is the Prime Matter, the Round Chaos, then, Nameless Realm, had to be either Void's name, given by Owlites, or the realm stemming from the Void or coexisting with it. We have suggested, that souls and energy had to come from somewhere, and suggested it to be Nameless Realm prior ot a detailed analysis of the Void.

Then there is existence of dragons, which we so far considered far more ancient species. As with the creation myth, dragons are generally thought of as the most ancient creatures, which fits with our established timeline. Since the dragons of Spiral Knights exist in 3 subspecies, and as we concluded, capable of traversing Underworld and material realm, what makes then incapable of also accessing the supposed divine realm, characterized so far as Nameless Realm and/or Whitespace, mainly to how elemental defense is the one protection in Nameless Realm.

If Whitespace contains Sleeper, and is found within the Core, it would be questionable, how in the first place Whitespace was found or summoned. We could attempt to rely on Owlites, as they are the closest to those concepts, essentially by that making Whitespace same as Nameless Realm, or at least its part in the Core. As with Kats, there is no information on Whitespace's prior existence, while Nameless Realm has most of motifs shared with Whitespace, apart from chaos.

We have previously considered the [creation myth]() as one depicting divinity of dragons. In it, storm dragon was the one closest to a divine dragon, whose passing created sun and mountains, the foundation for the world, as it was explicitly stated to be created, compared to being razed and shaped, as if there was a specific sequence by which dragons' power could create a world.

As far as established concepts go, we can suggest, that creation of the world in this myth could be more literal than initially thought. Weather it is so, Nameless Realm, we propose to be the exact realm wherein the aforementioned deific entities exist. The Whitespace would fit in this framework as an intermediate point of transitioning from material realm into the Nameless Realm by the fact of being contained in the Core so that it had to be summoned in the first place. This would parallel to the idea of opening the Void from material realm. Through the existence of Kataclysm and Grim Gates, we can conclude, that this ability to intersect the realms is part of material realm physics encompassing any realm, including Apocrean Realm. Apocrean Realm in this structure seem to be closer to the Underworld, and, due to its eldritch nature, it might exist on its own, most separate from the rest, but nonetheless connected.

And, as paradoxical nature of the Void and hunger being at the origin of the world, we suggest, that Nameless Realm and Whitespace being this other part of the dual, paradoxical, alchemical nature of the Prime Matter. And, through the themes of divinity we can place more certainly Nameless Realm as one from which, then, energy and souls are derived from, eventually reaching the Void, uniting with it. Within this conception, Apocrean Engines, which run on souls, might be the eldritch interloper within this more traditional cosmology.

<!-- Apocrea specifically represents some interesting motifs:

- <a href="https://wiki.spiralknights.com/Apocrean_Harvester" target="_blank">Apocrean harvester</a> has symbolism of 3 eyes
scarabs have 3 eyes and are associated with the Undead
- Apocrea thematically is associated with Lovecraftian mythos, but the connection, with Scarabs introduced, is deeper:
- Both scarabs and Apocrean harvester resemble insects in their anatomy, or at least, Arthropods
- Presence of 3 eyes must be reinstated, as the only instance of such symbolism we observe at the respawn pads in the Whitespace, apart from being related to a symbol of alchemical silver.
- Back in [Arrival of Undercorp](#arrival-of-undercorp) Snarbolax was pointed out as one with the cursed mane and prior of 3 eyes, it was likely intentional design choice to demonstrate the capacity of the curse in its many forms. -->

##### The Resonance

- `The Nine are blind, they cannot see the Truth that lies below. The Nine are deaf, they cannot hear the Resonance that beats within this world. Herex no longer serves as one of the Nine. Only Herex sees and hears the Truth` (<a href="https://wiki.spiralknights.com/Spark_and_Roar/Hidden_Hideout" target="_blank">Spark and Roar - Hidden Hideout - Recon Module - Herex</a>).
- `Infiltrate the Complex. Take all schematics. The Nine are quite but we will silence them. The Knights persue but we will halt them. Only Herex comprehends the Truth. Only Herex will descend. There can be no other` (<a href="https://wiki.spiralknights.com/Complex_357" target="_blank">Crimson Chaos - Complex 357 - Herex</a>).

Comprehension of truth is tied to being located in the Core. The truth is equal to the metaphor of hearing the resonance beating, then, in the Core. Based of the idea of Crimson Order sealing the Core as an aftereffect of Architect's madness and betrayal, the analogue to being blind and deaf seem to fit, as being cut off the truth within the Core. Herex's Truth in that context means following Architect's madness. Which, through the alignment with the Swarm, seem to suggest it being a truth from the perspective of madness.

So, does this mean that the Swarm is referred as the Truth? We have clues, thematic at that. The only concrete distinction of the Swarm is that it opposes Sleeper and it was brought to existence through a combination of 2 essentials - Void and Whitespace, and a potential introduction of curse.

In that regard, Whitespace Swarm had to be introduced to the Void though an act of opening the later by someone, in order for the Swarm to feel Void's endless hunger. This, we believe, connects Architect's madness and Swarms' creation.

If we consider, how Underworld, through curse, had affected Kats, Black Kats, Snarbolax and Lord Vanaduke, we can extrapolate this change onto the initial Swarm of Whitespace within the idea of Swarm being the entity assisting in Clockworks construction. On the other hand it is the Void which potentially corrupts and is identified by void variations of enemies.

The Void in that case is of similar nature to curse as both spread as far as possible once introduced to a different medium from theirs, but, the Void has a property of being before world was created, at that we souls consider the cosmology as ever-reaching the equilibrium of everything falling back into the Void.

If we were to introduce aspect of the curse, we would lean to the idea of Swarm being the manifestation of a failure to create divine alchemical Rebis, failing to properly combine opposites of Prime Matter as the primordial Void and divine Nameless Realm, in order to complete the Great Work. In this alchemical connotation Cradle could be seen as the Great Work in the making, as it was built around slumbering Sleeper, and as of current discussion, when it awakens, it would not be likely vulnerable to currently presented dangers.

Chaos Cloak grants protection in the Nameless Realm, and is characterized by elemental defense. It also has depiction of an antique evil eye, linking to curse though this design, as well as weakness to curse and all statuses. The [Divine Veil], by nature of divine protects of all unnatural damage - shadow and elemental. Through the analysis of elementals, which [Clockwork facilities do incorporate](#clockworks-and-magitek), they also can be considered as unnatural, or magic as Spiral Order refers in the <a href="https://wiki.spiralknights.com/Arcana" target="_blank">Arcana</a>: `An exceptional handgun that fires powerful, elemental shots that many Spiral Knights refer to as 'magic missiles'`.

Compared to the affinity within Nameless Realm, divinity grants protection from curse. We have followed this logic during [intermediate analysis of curse]() - with this, we have gathered, that Nameless Realm incorporates curse as a natural phenomenon.

The [Divine Avenger]() [inverts](#inversion-of-curse) the curse, transforming it to elemental damage, yet with prevalent Dread Seal symbolism. This was covered in the [Inversion of Curse](#inversion-of-curse). This motif, encapsulated by the Avenger may be the exact lead we are searching for, due to to symbolism of gold in relation to divinity and as complementary color in Whitespace. A similar extrapolation was in the phenomenon of <a href="https://wiki.spiralknights.com/File:Area-March_of_the_Tortodrones-Ancient_Grove.png" target="_blank">glowing patterns on the Ancient Grove ruins</a>, outer carvings of <a href="https://wiki.spiralknights.com/Grand_Tortofist" target="_blank">Tortofists</a>, and inner surface of <a href="https://wiki.spiralknights.com/Grand_Tortoise" target="_blank">tortoise shields</a>, glow pattern of <a href="https://wiki.spiralknights.com/Gran_Faust" target="_blank">Gran Faut</a> and <a href="https://wiki.spiralknights.com/Volcanic_Plate_Shield" target="_blank">Volcanic Plate Shield</a>. All of those items relate to Underworld. In case of Ironmight, it was covered in the [Ironmight kingdom](#ironmight-kingdom) and [Volcanic elements](#volcanic-elements).

Due to this we propose a solution, which seems plausible and targets details of Swarms design and purpose.

We propose, that Whitespace is a stabilized presence of Nameless Realm in material realm through containment in the Core. By proxy of Whitespace, Nameless Realm embodies a divine aspect of real-world alchemical Prime Matter while preserving its chaotic nature. It exists as the highest realm within which divine entities exist. The Void present the whole from which creation of known cosmology stems and from which at some point Nameless Realm had to also separate, containing a capacity to contain souls as energy, while the Void became the absence of those.

In the context of Clockworks, Whitespace is utilized to assist in Clockworks' construction under Sleeper's will, as Sleeper is contained within the Core. By introducing the Void into Whitespace would result it its nature be united with the Void: on one hand, - a unification of opposite interpretations of Prime Matter, a marriage of opposites producing divine Rebis, but in the other, the final end of Universe, as all is drawn to the Void by following a myth of originating from it. Hunger of the void is posed as an essential, dangerous element, which is implied to perpetuate Swarm's motif of consuming everything.

Based on the idea of Swarm using power of the Core to expand and grow, we suggest it is the case of its original nature from Whitespace required to be sustained in the devoid of the connection with Whitespace state by the fact of Core being sealed. The Void then serves as a reason for Swarm's expansion. This hunger would potentially perpetuate Swarm to utilize all of its capabilities, that of using souls, it order to expand and consume.

But, if we to follow this unconscious hunger, then motif of an eye and power to directly manipulate souls seems fitting only for entities with a will and animated by curse.

At that, motif of divinity would be likely preserved, if only Void and Whitespace would be united, as it seems natural order of all things. But, we know certainly, that it is the curse, which inverts any divinity, - the prime example for it being <a href="https://wiki.spiralknights.com/Armor_of_the_Fallen" target="_blank">Armor of the Fallen</a>, which is related to curse. Here <a href="https://wiki.spiralknights.com/Crown_of_the_Fallen" target="_blank">Crown of the Fallen</a> halo would be the most direct representation of any darkness.

Due to the rest of Swarm's design, apart from its blackness derived from the Void, pink color and eye symbolism we attribute to curse, as in the first time we proposed it to be extrapolated onto an entity from a different realm. As both Void and Nameless Realm proper are the foundations of the Universe, curse would be accounted for, and so it would be negated.

What would not be negated is its corrupting influence, as seen across corrupted tortodrones, - while they are built to protect titans, introduction of dark matter seemingly aligns them with the Underworld, while power source it their base is the same as far as minerals' capabilities allow. In applied to the Swarm, curse would only manifest as a change in the design and amplification of the original intent, similar to Kat Tribe and other known entities affected by curse.

Then there is pink color, present in the design of Swarm-native entities and lightning arcs within the skydome of the Unknown Passage. Pink design of prior is similar to presence of gold in Whitespace in respect to its abstracted design, specifically, of a golden crystal used to open the gates. The lightning is one associated with Clockworks' Power Complexes and exterior of the Core. Based on the fact Swarm feeds off the Core, the lightnings could be of this nature.

The pink lightning in particular is seen in 4 other instances:

- Arkus's Leviathan strike, summoning crystals, which in this context can finally be explained as instant condensation of energy to crystals as we proposed them - minerals - to be.
- Lightning striking the ritual site in Moorcroft Manor prior to summoning Margrel.
- Trojans' charge, which inflicts shock and creates lightnings.
- Lord Vanaduke's arcs of lightning during his cast of Fire Snakes spell. This was not brought up before, but now we see it as a perfect opportunity to discuss.
- Sparks of Life could also be attributed to this phenomenon, despite being different color.
- <a href="https://wiki.spiralknights.com/Storm_Caller#Storm_Caller" target="_blank">Storm Caller</a>: `A party favor of the gods, used to summon a lightning bolt from the heavens`, <a href="https://wiki.spiralknights.com/Frenzy_Caller#Frenzy_Caller" target="_blank">Frenzy Caller</a>: `A party favor of the gods, used to summon a flash of frenzy from the heavens`, and <a href="https://wiki.spiralknights.com/Rage_Caller#Rage_Caller" target="_blank">Rage Caller</a>: `A party favor of the gods, used to summon a shaft of rage from the heavens` all describe the lightning striking the ground as one originating from heavens, while relating to the prize boxes of according themes.

The idea, that we believe unites them all, is the folklore interpretation of lightning adapted into the setting, mentioned in relation to [Arkus](#arkus-the-design), - of a divine intervention. In the setting of Spiral Knights this would be a sign of a momentarily established connection with the a higher or lower realm in the cases above - with the Underworld, and in case of Sparks and Callers, - with the Nameless Realm. In case of Arkus, transformed into trojan, his proximity to it increased to a point of him transforming into a fiend. Then, as he, as trojans, has dark matter, which as we concluded being the symptom, rather that the reason for the affliction. And this exact affliction allows for a connection to Underworld's physics and grants immortality through manifestation of curse and channeling of energy seen in the lightnings. This logic was applied to Lord Vanaduke and Darkfire Vanaduke, as in both instances they are cursed by Underworldly powers.

The remaining question is how curse had supposedly managed to remain in case of the Swarm if we earlier established that both Nameless Realm and the Void contain it. We suggest it being the fact that Whitespace is not Nameless Realm proper, and the idea of curse afflicting entity of Whitespace prior to opening the Void should be a reason and intent to open it in a similar manner to Phantoms bearing characteristic curse while located in supposed between Underworld and material realm of [graveyards](#graveyards).

Only after this corruption, Void was introduced to an already faulty entity, as it was afflicted by curse. The connection to the Underworld here would not be this explicit, as the afflicted entity is of a different realm, where we can give the design a desired vagueness to be less likely to be identified as afflicted by a common curse.

We do not know what curse is supposed to look and feel like in a non-material realm, apart from the first-hand impressions of the Apocrean Realm, its designs, and underworld-native entities, as <a href="https://wiki.spiralknights.com/Greaver" target="_blank">greavers</a>, from which this symbolism of curse had began.

It is then the nature of Swarm which encompasses all of it. As curse was encountered in large amount of shapes, forms, and manifestations, under a specific application it is plausible to manifest unseen earlier phenomenon. We propose that:

**The Swarm is a union of an entity of Whitespace, driven by a transformative nature of curse, and amplified by the direct contact with the Void.**

Through the primordial nature of the Void, the organic motif is incorporated into the divine themes of Whitespace, and manifested as the evil eye with an organic aspect - seen as the Swarm entity found in Dreams and Nightmares, The Path is Revealed.

The last element to this narrative, we are required to look at the greater narratives across the established timeline, as well as the idea of Architect's madness.

##### The Madness

Returning to Architect's madness. We will follow with the proposal of king Tinkinzar being the Architect, one to live through existence of Cradle from its conception.

It is here we should finally look at the name of Clockworks. The name suggests, that it is a clock, and a countdown. Based of: `VULNERABLE IN SLUMBER, WORLDS WERE DRAWN TO SHIELD ME FROM THE DARKNESS. THIS WORLD HAS BECOME MY PRISON. IN HIS MADNESS, THE ARCHITECT BETRAYED THE PACT. TWISTING HIS CREATION INTO A GAME OF DEATH, IT NOW DEVOURS ALL WHO ENTER ITS IRON EMBRACE.` ([Echo Stone: Ironclaw Munitions Factory](https://wiki.spiralknights.com/Echo_Stone:_Ironclaw_Munitions_Factory)), we can suggest, that this term is referring to Sleeper's awakening. So, what should follow the awakening? As far as natural order goes, and its position in Whitespace, essentially Nameless Realm, we can suggest a paradigm shift, which we belie, is the reason behind spirits returning to material realm.

Then, there is a Pact, which, considering nature of Sleeper from the perspective of material realm, a supernatural, a Pact with a deity. while attempting to cross-reference the general structure of this narrative, we found a myth involving the concept of a philosopher-king and deities, which might serve as a basis for the story to be subverted within the story of the Architect.

The following concept is one of more general trope of a king's rule being taken over by a council of multiple figures, due to king's breakdown under an ambiguous, varying across myths and stories, reasons. But one particular example, which by itself serves as the foundation for such narrative, is the aforementioned concept of a philosopher-king, - king Solomon.

- The Architect, supposed to be king Tinkinzar, makes a Pact with an entity known as Sleeper.

  Details of the Pact are vague, but, from our understanding, it has 2 essential elements: Sleeper had to be protected from the darkness in what ill eventually become Cradle and gremlins are to be placed in charge of Cradle's defenses (`Once, the gremlins were in charge of maintaining Cradle's defenses. But they had their own plans` - <a href="https://wiki.spiralknights.com/Dreams_and_Nightmares/Refuge" target="_blank">Dream and Nightmares - Refuge - Parma's Scout</a>).

  This seems as a beneficial act, as Sleeper would provide resources for initial construction of Clockworks, while gremlins do the work, in the process creating Great Colony. The Sleeper's resource we are referring to is the assistance to gremlins in construction of Clockworks in the form of matter-materializing entity, which would become the Swarm, as evident by the ability of Whitespace to manufacture solid matter out of nothing in the events of Unknown Passage, and potential creation of Divine/Whitespace Clockwork tunnels in [A Step Beyond]().

- As all clans serve the Great Colony, and by proxy king Tinkinzar, we can suggest, that gremlin clan structure or at least the stained relation between them was not so prominent, as the rule was initially more stable, yet absolute, than it is found during the present game's events.

  As gremlin clans located in their according stratums, forming the general territory of what could've been considered gremlin empire on across Clockworks, we can draw, that, with the delegation of factories to clans, such as Ironclaw Munitions Factory, the general stability of the civilization would not be of a concern, until a dispute arises.

  Such event, we propose, is the madness and disappearance of the king, and, with no king, reign had to be taken over by Crimson Order. Within this, more mythological interpretation, the statements as `King Tinkinzar alone upholds the Iron Law!` from the screens at Engines of War, would seem as maintenance of the status quo by the Iron Law.

- The madness in question, then, if we are looking for its reason as external, should thematically be related to such entities as Nefarious Imp or Apocrea.

  Considering prior civilizations, - Owlites and Tortomega, - they seem to fall due to scheming of Underworld. In the context of Sleeper, as it is one entity required to be protected from the darkness, we believe, is a hint at the nature of the madness. As it is stated: `Shadow damage is generally caused by concentrations of negative energy. Attacks that inflict shadow damage include anything from the psychic manipulation of the aforementioned negative energy to physical attacks using weapons forged from dark matter` (<a href="https://wiki.spiralknights.com/The_Shadow_Knows" target="_blank">The Shadow Knows - Hahn</a>), which is by itself is an assault on the sentience, as, by proxy, dark matter: `A fabled mineral dark and ominous in color said to contain the essences of both chaos and nothingness`.

  This seems as a hint to the induced nature of madness.

Essentially, we are linking Tinkinzar's madness, themes of alchemical Great Work, a repeated pattern of civilizations crumbling to Underworld's presence and schemes, introduction of cosmic horror motifs, - to Swarm's creation, as one related to Underworld though the incorporation of curse into the narrative:

- Presence of cosmic horror by its themes suspends the concept of "Truth" in the themes of cosmic incomprehensibility.

  This theme introduces a justified motif of madness within the abstracted cosmic horror story. Based on the eldritch component of the narrative, it is revealing nature of truth as maddening by being a case of <a href="https://tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/GoMadFromTheRevelation" target="_blank">going mad from the revelation</a>. It is embodied by Herex and a later rank missions transition to this theme most recognized by seeming inexplicability of the Swarm.

- The concept of king Tinkinzar, as we have proposed, to be linked to the trope of the trope of the philosopher-king, stemming from the king Solomon. Due to this we proposed an existence of a parallel between Tinkinzar's vision of Clockworks and Solomon's divine inspiration and vision of the First Temple.

  Then it is the quote, - `IN HIS MADNESS, THE ARCHITECT BETRAYED THE PACT` ([Echo Stone: Ironclaw Munitions Factory](https://wiki.spiralknights.com/Echo_Stone:_Ironclaw_Munitions_Factory)), - which we suggest being here a deconstruction of Solomon's eventual end as God left him, with the full punishment following later, as the kingdom would be divided after Solomon's death. So is the idea of the Great Colony being then ruled over by the Crimson order, which followed after Tinkinzar's madness. The madness here, we suggest, holds the aspect of above motif of cosmic horror story.

- Then, the last component - due to which, mainly, the entire timeline was reconstructed, - the pattern of Underworld's intervention first as a newfound source of power desired within the context of an isolated narrative.

  It is represented by Titans falling to Undercorp, Owlites erased by Kataclysm, Almire falling due to Lord Vanaduke's actions, and several smaller narratives such as trojans, kat tribe, and Snarbolax, - all related to different iterations and manifestations of curse as both literal and metaphorical carrier of Underworld's presence. Then, by addition to each iteration of a greater scope of the narrative than previous - as Titans were set in the woods, as Almire was a kingdom eventually becoming and undead Empire, and as Owlites were set in the setting of the entirety of heavenly kingdom, gremlins are paired with an entire planet, while encompassing all of the prior, - this seems as a distinct narrative if framed in such manner.

  Here a deconstruction of the concept of Underworld is presented through the identified actor, - a corporate entity - Undercorp, and by a more mysterious actor - Nefarious Imp, who we suspected to be related to Underworld's lingering presence on Cradle. Here, we believe, gremlins are fulfilling this role of the repeating patter, as they are known to work with Undercorp.

With end of civilizations facing with the Underworld and falling, brought into the Clockworks as past histories, with high stakes, it would be fitting for the nature of this narrative's danger be the same, yet drawn to the extremes as far as the established metaphysics of the fictional Universe would allow, without breaking the suspension of disbelief by an unpredictable force, which was written into the canon in the last moment.

With all of those components, we suggest the justification behind introduction of curse to the story of Swarm's creation, as an ultimate failure to uphold the Pact struck with the Sleeper due to Underworld's influence. The madness aspect then is reinstated by the possible cosmic horror nature of truth/madness as one related to an already eldritch entity apart from alchemical Nameless Realm, that being Apocrea, and potentially channeled or represented through actions of a single entity, such as Nefarious Imp.

As for the alchemical motifs, we seem them here as also subverted. Within this thought framework, it would be fitting to be the truth behind immortality as reason for induced madness - as the final goal of alchemy, - achieved either through curse, as seen prior, or alignment with the supposedly divine powers of the Sleeper, which would've been an explanation for Tinkinzar's longevity up until his madness, while following the idea of greater darkness endangering Sleeper.

In that sense, referring to the alchemical lore, - Herex's goal is one of intentionally replicating a state of immortality, accidentally achieved before by past civilizations. The process is flawed and requires incorporation of curse, essentially a damnation, causing extermination of kingdoms and species as a consequence. Yet, it manages to follow general alchemical lore of immortality being the Magnum Opus, Great Work, the Philosopher's Stone and Elixir of Immortality, which, given interconnectedness of mechanical with magical in [Clockworks and Magitek](#clockworks-and-magitek), seems particularly conclusive.

Arrival of Isorians being framed as fated seems to be a continuation of a concluded narrative within the nature of the game as one without a distinct end, but also as a final attempt to alchemically and symbolically redeem the past events in even greater stakes, as suggested by Sleeper: `WITHIN MY DREAM I SEE YOUR LEGION FALLING TO THIS WORLD LIKE BURNING STARS. YOU FALL WITH PURPOSE, BURNING EVER BRIGHTER AS YOU REACH FOR THE HEART OF THIS WORLD. HOLD DEARLY THIS FIRE IN YOU, FOR DARKNESS WILL CONSUME ALL THE NIGHT IF ITS STARS BEGIN TO FADE.` ([Echo Stone: Royal Jelly Palace](https://wiki.spiralknights.com/Echo_Stone:_Royal_Jelly_Palace)).

#### Rebis Theory

Rebis theory proposes the existence of an alchemical framework, which constitutes a narrative at the foundation of interaction across the material realm, Nameless Realm, the Void, metaphysics of curse and Underworld, as parts of a unified cosmology through metaphors and interpretations of alchemical lore.

Rebis theory proposes an existence of alchemical narrative within the story of Clockworks and Cradle. This alchemical narrative, a hermetic truth, serves as the foundation for the motifs of characters which operate within this set of physical laws, exploring potential ends of the Great Work in its many instances across history of Cradle, Clockworks, and civilizations which were incorporated into prior.

Then, on top of this alchemy and mythology-based framework, first isolated narratives of Titans - Tortomega, Owlites, and gremlins are applied, and then they are framed within a context of the Rebis theory, resulting in the repeated patterns of Underworld intervening. The name itself - Rebis, - is then used to represent the end goal of this overarching narrative, greatest failure to satisfy which is manifested as the Swarm, representing a failed unity of opposites: Whitespace, or in fact, the Nameless Realm, and the Void. While both represent the alchemical interpretation of First Matter and its Chaos, within the proposed cosmology they are located at the metaphysical opposites. The Swarm is the union of both, corrupted by introduction of Underworld-native Curse.

_"Should You Choose to Accept"_

</SubTitleCentered>

In this chapter we will cover entirety of the timeline from the very beginning.

<SubTitleCentered>

#### `DEPTH 29`

</SubTitleCentered>

- In the beginning exists the Void, from which all matter originates in the form of material realm, Nameless Realm, Underworld with the Blinding Abyss, and Apocrean Realm.

  Those realms are stacked on top of each other:

  - The Void is at the foundation. When a Universe was created from it, the Void gained hunger characterized by a lack of existence within it, drawing everything to itself.
  - The rest of existence has manifested as the Apocrean Realm, Underworld and its Abyss stretching to the metaphysical bottom of the world, material realm and then the Nameless Realm.
  - Nameless Realm became at the top, and it contains all of the supernatural energy, from which souls flow into the material realm. It is the realm of Energy as Spiral order knows it.
  - Souls manifest as consciousness in the material realm, and auras become the energy radiance of those souls beyond physical bodies.
  - As souls are energy so is everything, minerals and fire crystals are phenomenon of energy from the Nameless Realm arriving in large amounts into the material realm.

<SubTitleCentered>

#### `DEPTH 28`

</SubTitleCentered>

-Underworld and Apocrean Realm by the nature of being the furthers from the Nameless Realm, are metaphysically sustained by souls, which arrive there as their bodies perish in the material realm. This would be the main catalyst for both Underworld, - as Undercorp, as well as Apocrea to bring those souls to them.

<SubTitleCentered>

#### `DEPTH 27`

</SubTitleCentered>

- From souls and sentience civilizations emerge, the first one being dragons. They were capable of traversing entire metaphysical landscape, traversing though those realms.

  In physiology, there were of storms and elemental properties of Nameless Realm, of frenzy and shadow, and of rage.

<SubTitleCentered>

#### `DEPTH 26`

</SubTitleCentered>

- Valkyries, later be known as Owlites, emerge. For now they are known as the celestial beings in the heavenly kingdom, located in proximity to the Nameless Realm.

<SubTitleCentered>

#### `DEPTH 25`

</SubTitleCentered>

- By that time dragons had descendants - drakes, wyverns and tortoises. Among them, only tortoises had developed into a civilization, known as tortomega upon the planet, which wold eventually become Cradle. Their homeland would be the now shattered Aurora Isles, with the rest of their territory located in the Gloaming Wildwoods.

<SubTitleCentered>

#### `DEPTH 24`

</SubTitleCentered>

- Valkyries hunted and slayed dragons, allowing for a outflow of energy to be created and manipulated with. That is the creation myth. As far as it goes, it was not the creation of the material realm, but rather a statement on the extent of the power dragons wielded, which was released in their passing. But this event also caused creation of godlike valkyrians, known as riders, known for their ability to manipulte the released primordial elemnts.

<SubTitleCentered>

#### `DEPTH 23`

</SubTitleCentered>

- Underworld develops by itself in isolation from the material realm.
- Isorians emerge as a civilization. They evolved separately from Owlites, but near the time to encounter dragons.

<SubTitleCentered>

#### `DEPTH 22`

</SubTitleCentered>

- Underworld is shortly discovered by Isorians, which shaped their own culture and myths.
- By the time Isorians became a spacefaring civilization, they started hunting dragons, primarily for the resources. But, with this power they eventually discovered universal energy, found in dragons passing, eventually developing into an interstellar empire. Spiral order was established.

<SubTitleCentered>

#### `DEPTH 21`

</SubTitleCentered>

- Tortomega and Valkyries are warring civilization in the material realm. During this period tortomega would become known as Titans. The relation between both is complex. Primarily, titans assisted in building floating castles for valkyries as did vlkyrian riders, carbing worlds from stone. Those castles composed the known heavenly kingdom within the material realm. Due to greater stability of this period, decorates statues and busts of titans were carved in several castles as a form of rememberance.
- But, as the war went on, titans were pressed by valkyries back into the woods. In this state, Titans discovered the Underworld.
- By that point Underworld contained a fully developed civilization and, specifically, corporations. One of corporations would become on the forefront of the Underworld, known as Undercorp.
- As Titans uncovered Underworld, under a lead of the Nefarious Imp, both civilization in beneficial agreement managed to back up.

  This introduced shadow graviton technology to material realm, Underworld's culture, and skillful usage of energy within minerals, dark matter specifically. Through this technology, tortodrones were developed, initially utilizing power of crimsonite, which was close to the nature of tortomega as descendants of dragons, of red dragons specifically, which wielded through their nature powers of rage.

  Through further development of graviton technology, Grim Gates were built, though which devilite cities were transported into material realm.

<SubTitleCentered>

#### `DEPTH 20`

</SubTitleCentered>

- At some point, Undercorp betrays Titans and subdues them by the same machinery of tortodrones, originally developed to assist Titans.

  Those tortodrones were modified across dark cities' laboratories with the dark matter, and then transported through the grim gates across targeted locations to initialize the onslaught of titans. One of those initial location was later discovered by Spiral order on Cradle, known as the Ancient Grove, repurposed by Undercorp to serve as a staging area for tortodrones.

- As Titans are at war with Undercorp, they break all connection with the Underworld through destruction of Grim Gates. This causes an unaccounted behavior of graviton technology to destabilize.

  While for Undercorp it was only a series of explosions, improper breakage of the connection on their part releases curse, native to Underworld, from the gates into the material realm. In case of titans the surrounding area was ridden by curse in uncontrolled manner pouring into the woods, afflicting wildlife of the Gloaming Wildwoods. Due to this, Snarbolax as an immortal bearer of curse, was born, as a transformed species close to wolvers.

<SubTitleCentered>

#### `DEPTH 19`

</SubTitleCentered>

- Remaining Titans flee in the remaining territories within the Aurora Isles and fall into deep sleep, in order to hide and outlive the erasure of their civilization. The remaining tortodrones are left without their masters. This place where Titans had fallen to slumber will be known as Starlight Cradle.
- At that, the spread of curse across the woods had not ended, as its excess had resulted in a poisonous miasma to emerge, characterized by crimson fog. By the time miasma has passed, most of the tortomega civilization was erased.

<SubTitleCentered>

#### `DEPTH 18`

</SubTitleCentered>

- Isorians are now a spacefaring civilization with an established Spiral Order. Those spacefaring vessels came before any major colonies were established. One of such vessels falls on planet later to become Cradle, wherein all technological advancements was not as well advanced. This is the planet, inhabited by valkyries and formerly titans, being a planet, which would eventually be reconstructed into Cradle.

<SubTitleCentered>

- Those stranded Isorians develop a medieval civilization, which would eventually become the kingdom of Almire, kingdom of Ironmight, and of northerns settlements of raiders.
- Near that time Underworld is found by Isorians for the second time and Valkyries are generally hold neutral. This epoch will be known as the forgotten time.

  During this period of time some most ancient weapons would be created, which, by virtue, carried into the modern times, such as inherited from Titans heavy swords with an amount of inner elemental energy, gunpowder-powered handguns, and blades forged to slay the undead. Gunslinger priests they were called.

    trojans

    These designs would eventually be adopted by Valkyries, as it turns out, piercing weapons are effective against the Underworld fiends, and Isorians had only those in their disposal, due to lack of knowledge on underworld or of greater elemental powers.

<SubTitleCentered>

#### `DEPTH 15`

</SubTitleCentered>

- Isorians presented a danger to Valkyrian rule, as they had their experience with the Underworld.

  One of Valkyries, driven by ambition of power of Underworld, orchestrates a creation of a stone army, made of spiral wardens. Those became Trojans of Legion of Ur. For this, Fallen Valkyrian is banished from the heavenly kingdom. With this plot uncovered, Fallen Valkyrian and trojans, now known as Legion of Ur, conquer the Underworld.

- Due to this, heavenly kingdom now oversees the mountains, within which an entrance to the Underworld is hidden.

<SubTitleCentered>

#### `DEPTH 14`

</SubTitleCentered>

- In contrast to nature of those mountains, a kingdom of Almire flourishes, as it is under the divine protection of Spirit Mother.

  Near this kingdom, kingdom of Ironmight exists, which has in their disposal magical trees. From their wood one of most durable armors were created. And it was the kingdom to hold the economic power over the region.

  Almire in that regard had their own developments. While being a kingdom generally attuned to nature, it found fiery elemental in the mountains.

<SubTitleCentered>

#### `DEPTH 13`

</SubTitleCentered>

- Through the proximity to Underworld's influence, fiendish cults had there development there, leading to crating of altars to those Underworld deities.
- As heavenly kingdom remain in the sky, a war between Ironmight kingdom and kingdom of Almire breaks out. Northern raider assisted Ironmight kingdom.

<SubTitleCentered>

#### `DEPTH 12`

</SubTitleCentered>

- The war led to Almire's Fall and Lord Vanaduke leaving into mountains in search for myths, inherited from a war between Titans and Valkyries, including aftermath of Titan's erasure by Undercorp, and stories of legion of Ur.
- As war went, apart from a cult of a volcanic deity, later known to be, likely, Vog, across graveyards a different cult emerges - of a nameless Vile deity, related to poisons and rot.

<SubTitleCentered>

#### `DEPTH 11`

</SubTitleCentered>

- As Almire's army was overpower, Lord Vanaduke flees into the volcanic mountains. There, he finds fiery cult's chamber.

  It curses Lord Vanaduke, causing him to emerge from the mountains with an Underworld army of trojans.

- Lord Vanaduke returns, frees Almire of the invaders and conquers their lands. With this an undead Almirian Empire is founded.

<SubTitleCentered>

#### `DEPTH 10`

</SubTitleCentered>

- Empire of Almire initiates an onslaught onto heavenly kingdom.
- Valkyries invade Underworld in order to purge it of Legion of Ur, as they saw extent of their might. With this, they seal the Legion of ur in the Underworld.

</SubTitleCentered>

- A tribe of Kats develops, they invade heavenly kingdom, specifically Owlite Academy, and through ill-usage of tomes located there, cause Kataclysm, erasing both civilizations.

  Kataclysm takes part of Owlite Academy at the epicenter of the cataclysm into the realm close to the Underworld.

<SubTitleCentered>

#### `DEPTH 8`

</SubTitleCentered>

- This state of affairs lasts for a long time, until the planet was found by gremlin interstellar empire.

  Here the first contact with the Sleeper was established by king Tinkinzar. Sleeper reveals itself as a ancient entity, unprotected by heavenly kingdom, yet capable of beneficial actions.

- Sleeper shows Tinkinzar a grand vision of what will eventually become Cradle, devised to be a new home for gremlins, as they protect it.

<SubTitleCentered>

#### `DEPTH 7`

</SubTitleCentered>

- In this vision Clockworks are built, utilizing both knowledge of elementals as well as more natural sciences.

  The Core, which would contain and protect Sleeper, introduced Nameless Realm into the material realm in the form of contained Whitespace. Several control points are built to secure access to the Core, the Sanctuary, wherein Sleeper is located. This action also marks the moment spirits are forbidden from completely leaving into the afterlife.

  This creates a metaphysical shift, as departed spirit now return to material realm, but severing Underworld, and making graveyards from Almirian age far more dangerous. As fallen civilization came back to life, apart from eternally shrouded by curse Almire and Owlites, forcing them to be contained within Clockworks. As such, graveyards of the Almirian Empire are now brought down in proximity of Underworld by the amount of souls after Almirian-Ironmight war contained there and unable to depart. it is such due to still slumbering Sleeper as a divine entity, and only after its proper awakening, metaphysics of Cradle would eventually return to general normal.

- The king reunites all warring gremlin clans, giving the most prosperous time for the empire, located in the Great Colony.

<SubTitleCentered>

#### `DEPTH 6`

</SubTitleCentered>

- Eventually the king succumbs to madness, which accompanied him in later years, breaking the agreement.

  Tinkinzar's madness is considered to be brought by Undercorp's intervention, specifically, Nefarious Imp. In the result, curse was be applied at the nature of Nameless Realm, now present in material realm as the Whitespace.

  This transformation and introduction of curse results in the foundation of Clockworks' building resource to be influenced by curse, yet, due to its nature of Nameless Realm, it was in greater proximity to the fundamental alchemical forces of the universe, tapping directly into the Void. Amplified and merged with the chaotic nature of the Void, the Swarm was created - an inverse of what it initially was.

- As king was succumbing to madness, an Order of 9 members, Crimson Order, was founded to uphold king's reign. Under the reign of Crimson Order Iron Law is established as a measure of containing the failing empire as well as the Swarm at a cost of sealing the Core, which imprisoned the Sleeper within its confinements.
- The Core is sealed, Core Terminal's passage is destroyed, and the device, the Artifact, used to activate thee consoles, is hidden.
- While the Core is sealed, the Swarm hidden within mirrors itself endlessly and th Swarm on the outside breaches the Core

<SubTitleCentered>

#### `DEPTH 5`

</SubTitleCentered>

- Across Isorian colonies a war erupts, leading to a prolonged conflict, known as the Morai Wars. This war leaves most of the civilization in ruins and without a sun. This causes all parties to search an unprecedented energy source.

<SubTitleCentered>

#### `DEPTH 4`

</SubTitleCentered>

- Morai vessel in their search for energy, stumbles onto Cradle and is shot down by its defenses. Morai soldier are raised from the dead under Core's influence. As the Citadel, and as undead, they are contained by gremlins.

- Near a hundred years later, another, now Isorian vessel - Skylark, - would discover Cradle. Cradle's defenses strike Skylark down, causing it to crash land on Cradle's surface. This, finally, leads to the events of the game.

<SubTitleCentered>

#### `DEPTH 1`

</SubTitleCentered>

- Crimson Order member Herex is influenced by the same madness as one afflicted Tinkinzar, causing him to seek hidden Artifact.

  It was retrieved, applied to the console in Owlite ruins now ruled by the Jelly King. After activation the Core had opened for a moment, exactly by the time Alpha Squad reached the Core Terminal in pursuit of the Swarm, which felt the Core opening.

  After that the Artifact was brought into the derelict facility below Rescue Camp near Haven Arcade, and Razwog was tasked to recharge the Artifact.

<SubTitleCentered>

#### `DEPTH 0`

</SubTitleCentered>

- Skylark discovers Cradle, and is hit by gremlin shadow artillery. This decision was made in order to prevent any possibility of the Swarm escaping under the directive of Iron Law.
- Skylark crash lands, main generator broken with the secondary generator moved to Strangers' Haven Lab, which remained at planet surface. Strangers persisted through Almire conflict, Katastrophe and emergence of Clockworks.

  Skylark secondary generator has design similar to Arcade's Gate Pillars, as well as generator left base, I'll skip the asset flip theory, focusing strictly on lore implication this similarity.

- Alpha Squad begins a descend. Based on energy spike discovered at the Royal Jelly Palace and then at the Firestorm Citadel, with the Core opening at least twice, with the second being the event of Dreams and nightmares, it is likely that the time Artifact was used in the RJP, was by the time Alpha Squad managed to descend to the Core Terminal, and, as in DaN, is hunted by the Swarm, attracted to the opening hatch from te Shadow Lairs
- Spiral battle sprites are transformed into images of the past civilization by the Core through same power of mirroring as it manifested Clockworks from Whitespace.

  For all sprites, to fully manifest their powers, <a href="https://wiki.spiralknights.com/Ultimate_Evo_Catalyst#Evo_Catalyst" target="_blank">catalysts</a> are used, as they contain far greater amount of energy, while being contained within same mechanism in design and principle of a flat, plated structure, as the Core. The source of Catalysts is, considering its' designs is created by gremlins fo their own use.

<!--

Material Realm is of regular matter, Nameless Realm specifically is the extension of the Void, and it is inhabited by divine entities

Through continuos research of Cradle and its past, gremlin king Tinkinzar of the Great Colony establishes a connection with the Nameless Realm, wherein Sleeper slept, through this connection a Pact was established:

The Sanctuary is the place of Sleeper, it is also the Refuge, all located within the Whitespace and Clockwork skydome.

Based on the analysis of skydomes, as they seemingly capable of constant suspension of the landmass within, this principle links back to the the Core as one object around which everything is built.

The Sanctuary Alchemy Machine, as the Mysterious Alchemy Station, have recipes Spiral Order could not have known, paralleling items - materials, equipment, furniture and costumes, - acquired for tokens. In the prior 2 cases, the ability of alchemy to transcend time and causality seems as most plausible explanation.

The symbol of alchemy in that regard, seem to belong to the nature of Whitespace, as no known machinery exists to manufacture Whitespace by gremlins, so, it is Sleeper's doing, which ties with the idea of the symbol of alchemy as one coming from the other realm. Here we also connect Spirit Mother's realm to Whitespace, as both contain sentience and relate to divinity. The distinction here is the nature of Whitespace as artificial transitory construction, which still allows for laws of material realm to exist - in a form of Clockwork technology. It is essentially a point off transition to the other realm in the same manner as graveyards and Owlite Academy are in the transitory state to the Underworld.

The Void then is the chaos and nothingness of Prime Matter. It can be shaped into anything, but requires the prolonged process of transformation. So is the Nameless Realm, which should have been the alchemical Void. -->

<!-- its capacity t replicate and to mirror is manifested as the regular firestorm citadel, while the Shadow citadel is the true one, with the power of the curse lingering? -->

<!-- a technology to build, or rather, mirror the rest of the Clockworks, powered by the Nameless Realm, its energy, emerged - the swarm. Originally, invention of gremlins, with the energy from the Nameless Realm, it is transformed into an semi-organic entity (in similar manner as spiral battle sprites will be transformed into biomechanical entities). Now It is an entity of very same energy of Nameless Realm, both a technology and a constant - a shape of the sentient energy same as the Sleeper, once it is brought into the material realm.

A Core is built and the rest of the clockworks were built by the swarm of machines, capable of replicating matter from energy. For the Nameless Realm separated fto the material realm gremlins had there own name - the Whitespace. Within the strange matter of whitespace, Sleeper now rests protected in the Core, separate from the unity and divinity of Nameless Realm proper, referred to as the Void, not malevolent one currently, but a form of most primordial of matter.

As Clockworks were built, some of the most dangerous entities of the Cradle were made hidden within the deepest parts of Clockworks, such as fallen Almirian capital - the Necropolis, Great Citadel, know only known as the Firestorm Citadel, and once floating through Cradle's sky Owlite Scarlet Fortress, traveling through Clockworks as a mass of castles.

https://wiki.spiralknights.com/The_Ancient_Generator

https://wiki.spiralknights.com/Crossing_the_Chasm

If Clockworks were being constructed during that time, they must have to originate from the Core, in order to be built, which ties in with the relation of an Architect and the Sleeper within the Shadow Lairs' Sanctuary, it also will be revisited later, but currently these possible implications must be kept in mind. This also leads to a possibility of gremlins originally being rather underground specie, as the Core either have been built in-place of Cradle's natural core, or was lowered theres.

The process of Core construction implies at least presence of the Core hatch, access consoles and the Artifact, with the consoles being present in a few locations on Cradle, including the Firestorm Citadel and Royal Jelly Palace. Now, considering that <a href="https://wiki.spiralknights.com/The_Gauntlet" target="_blank">the Gauntlet</a> is guarded by gremlins in the <a href="https://wiki.spiralknights.com/The_Gauntlet" target="_blank">Reign of Fire</a> as well as the <a href="https://wiki.spiralknights.com/The_Gauntlet/Last_Stand" target="_blank">Last Stand</a> has elements of Scarlet Fortress and Clockworks' monitors, it is plausible for gremlins to fortify this passage to the Citadel intentionally, for reasons explored in the next section.

Backing to the Core, the Whitespace within has same element of clockwork tunnels being replaced by Whitespace tiles, as well as an entire skydome structure present within the Core (<a href="https://wiki.spiralknights.com/Refuge" target="_blank">Refuge</a>, <a href="https://wiki.spiralknights.com/Sanctuary" target="_blank">Sanctuary</a>, if believed to be located within the Core), that must also be kept in mind for the overarching themes.

nameless realm of dreaming entities - which create, origin of souls as raw energy, and its opposite - apocrean realm whose inhabitants make nightmares, still create and are powered by souls, there souls die. The abyss just is?

The Void is weaponized by the presence of curse originating from the Underworld. This prime matter itself has no will no intent and flows from Nameless Realm into the material, both as the source of all matter but also as souls for living beings. Those 2 forms of primal matter are all at their core energy. This energy, mainly in form of souls, after death in material realm, reaches Underworld, and from there - into the Blinding Abyss. Apocrea here is the middleman who lives on that same energy, yet it can't reach Nameless Realm. Then it acts through underworld, whose death-based nature manifests as curse, which though actions of gremlins, had affected pure energy of Nameless Realm. This caused gremlins to seal Swarm with the portion of Nameless Realm within the Core, wherein core served as an extractor of energy from nameless realm.

Here we would return for the alchemy orbs and alchemy stations. With the knowledge of both energy in the setting, and of the vague nature of real-world alchemy, it being manifestations of energy in the same manner as fire crystals and minerals, but of higher order composition, for example, souls, as in charged minerals. We know that as they preserve the memory of the time they existed, yet they had to be indistinguishable, in order to perform stable alchemy. This lead to an idea, which would allow for the process of transmutation to work as intended, while remaining in the confinements of alchemy, - that is the hegelian World Spirit, an omnipresent unconscious memory of the world within a certain culture.

We arrive to this conclusion mainly due to optionality of recipes for Sanctuary and Mysterious alchemy station, as this would mean that the knight already, paradoxically, is aware of, for example, Almirian or Kat tribe designs. The only way those could exist, as if the knowledge of those was given. And, within the metaphysics of the Core, which tethers everything, such understanding would be plausible, as it is accumulated in a more reaving presence of an entity, knowing of what was happening throughout history.

The container of 2 golden plates, we suggest, is the same phenomenon as used on Cradle, to contain the divinity - of a part of Nameless Realm, - in the most pure metal. If we to follow alchemical symbolism of gold, it is the divine metal which is linked to the divinity, here symbolized by the cosmology of Nameless Realm.

`The work is crowned by the production of the rotundum, which, as the materia globosa, stands at the beginning and also at the end, in the form of gold.`

This makes it seem as if Orb of Alchemy already was the completed Work, and yet it is a tool in the general narrative.

In regards to the Fire Crystal, they have similar inner glow as orbs of alchemy. Apart from those similarities, heat is present as an floating essence, or as fire crystals. As with the energy and souls, we suggest, heat is the same in nature, that is it can be collected to crystals, under the same principle as minerals contain energy.
